#
# There are a number of spherical balloons spread in two-dimensional space. For
# each balloon, provided input is the start and end coordinates of the
# horizontal diameter. Since it's horizontal, y-coordinates don't matter and
# hence the x-coordinates of start and end of the diameter suffice. Start is
# always smaller than end. There will be at most 10^4 balloons.
# 
# An arrow can be shot up exactly vertically from different points along the
# x-axis. A balloon with xstart and xend bursts by an arrow shot at x if xstart
# ≤ x ≤ xend. There is no limit to the number of arrows that can be shot. An
# arrow once shot keeps travelling up infinitely. The problem is to find the
# minimum number of arrows that must be shot to burst all balloons.
# 
# Example:
# 
# 
# Input:
# [[10,16], [2,8], [1,6], [7,12]]
# 
# Output:
# 2
# 
# Explanation:
# One way is to shoot one arrow for example at x = 6 (bursting the balloons
# [2,8] and [1,6]) and another arrow at x = 11 (bursting the other two
# balloons).

class Solution:
    def findMinArrowShots(self, points: List[List[int]]) -> int:

        if not points:
            return 0

        points.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])

        res, end = 0, -float("inf")
        for interval in points:
            if interval[0] > end:
                res += 1
                end = interval[1]

        return res
