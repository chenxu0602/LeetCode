#
# Given a non-empty 2D array grid of 0's and 1's, an island is a group of 1's
# (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) You
# may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.
# 
# Find the maximum area of an island in the given 2D array. (If there is no
# island, the maximum area is 0.)
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# [[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],
# ⁠[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
# ⁠[0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
# ⁠[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],
# ⁠[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],
# ⁠[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],
# ⁠[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
# ⁠[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
# 
# Given the above grid, return 6. Note the answer is not 11, because the island
# must be connected 4-directionally.
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
# Given the above grid, return 0.
# 
# Note: The length of each dimension in the given grid does not exceed 50.
