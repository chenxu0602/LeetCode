# Testcase Example:  '3'
#
# Initially on a notepad only one character 'A' is present. You can perform two
# operations on this notepad for each step:
# 
# 
# Copy All: You can copy all the characters present on the notepad (partial
# copy is not allowed).
# Paste: You can paste the characters which are copied last time.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Given a number n. You have to get exactly n 'A' on the notepad by performing
# the minimum number of steps permitted. Output the minimum number of steps to
# get n 'A'.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: 3
# Output: 3
# Explanation:
# Intitally, we have one character 'A'.
# In step 1, we use Copy All operation.
# In step 2, we use Paste operation to get 'AA'.
# In step 3, we use Paste operation to get 'AAA'.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# The n will be in the range [1, 1000].

class Solution:
    def minSteps(self, n: int) -> int:
        # Prime Factorization
        # N = g_1 x g_2 x ... x g_n
        # p + q <= pq for p >= 2 and q >= 2
        # Time  complexity: O(sqrt(N))
        # Space complexity: O(1)
        # ans, d = 0, 2
        # while n > 1:
        #     while n % d == 0:
        #         ans += d
        #         n /= d
        #     d += 1
        # return ans

        if n == 1: return 0
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            if n % i == 0:
                return self.minSteps(n // i) + i
