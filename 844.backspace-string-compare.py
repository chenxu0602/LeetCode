#
# Given two strings S and T, return if they are equal when both are typed into
# empty text editors. # means a backspace character.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: S = "ab#c", T = "ad#c"
# Output: true
# Explanation: Both S and T become "ac".
# 
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: S = "ab##", T = "c#d#"
# Output: true
# Explanation: Both S and T become "".
# 
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: S = "a##c", T = "#a#c"
# Output: true
# Explanation: Both S and T become "c".
# 
# 
# 
# Example 4:
# 
# 
# Input: S = "a#c", T = "b"
# Output: false
# Explanation: S becomes "c" while T becomes "b".
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# 1 <= S.length <= 200
# 1 <= T.length <= 200
# S and T only contain lowercase letters and '#' characters.
# 
# 
# Follow up:
# 
# 
# Can you solve it in O(N) time and O(1) space?
