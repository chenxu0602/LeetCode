# 
# An integer interval [a, b] (for integers a < b) is a set of all consecutive
# integers from a to b, including a and b.
# 
# Find the minimum size of a set S such that for every integer interval A in
# intervals, the intersection of S with A has size at least 2.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# Input: intervals = [[1, 3], [1, 4], [2, 5], [3, 5]]
# Output: 3
# Explanation:
# Consider the set S = {2, 3, 4}.  For each interval, there are at least 2
# elements from S in the interval.
# Also, there isn't a smaller size set that fulfills the above condition.
# Thus, we output the size of this set, which is 3.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# Input: intervals = [[1, 2], [2, 3], [2, 4], [4, 5]]
# Output: 5
# Explanation:
# An example of a minimum sized set is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# intervals will have length in range [1, 3000].
# intervals[i] will have length 2, representing some integer interval.
# intervals[i][j] will be an integer in [0, 10^8].
