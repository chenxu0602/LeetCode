# Testcase Example:  '[1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0]\n2'
#
# Given an array A of 0s and 1s, we may change up to K values from 0 to 1.
# 
# Return the length of the longest (contiguous) subarray that contains only
# 1s. 
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: A = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], K = 2
# Output: 6
# Explanation: 
# [1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]
# Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1.  The longest subarray is
# underlined.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: A = [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1], K = 3
# Output: 10
# Explanation: 
# [0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]
# Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1.  The longest subarray is
# underlined.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# 1 <= A.length <= 20000
# 0 <= K <= A.length
# A[i] is 0 or 1 
# 
# 
# 
#

class Solution:
    def longestOnes(self, A: List[int], K: int) -> int:

        left = 0
        for right in range(len(A)):
            K -= 1 - A[right]
            if K < 0:
                K += 1 - A[left]
                left += 1
        return right - left + 1
