#
# Given a rows x cols screen and a sentence represented by a list of non-empty
# words, find how many times the given sentence can be fitted on the screen.
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# A word cannot be split into two lines.
# The order of words in the sentence must remain unchanged.
# Two consecutive words in a line must be separated by a single space.
# Total words in the sentence won't exceed 100.
# Length of each word is greater than 0 and won't exceed 10.
# 1 â‰¤ rows, cols â‰¤ 20,000.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1: 
# 
# Input:
# rows = 2, cols = 8, sentence = ["hello", "world"]
# 
# Output: 
# 1
# 
# Explanation:
# hello---
# world---
# 
# The character '-' signifies an empty space on the screen.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Example 2: 
# 
# Input:
# rows = 3, cols = 6, sentence = ["a", "bcd", "e"]
# 
# Output: 
# 2
# 
# Explanation:
# a-bcd- 
# e-a---
# bcd-e-
# 
# The character '-' signifies an empty space on the screen.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Example 3: 
# 
# Input:
# rows = 4, cols = 5, sentence = ["I", "had", "apple", "pie"]
# 
# Output: 
# 1
# 
# Explanation:
# I-had
# apple
# pie-I
# had--
# 
# The character '-' signifies an empty space on the screen.
