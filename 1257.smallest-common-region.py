#
# You are given some lists of regions where the first region of each list
# includes all other regions in that list.
# 
# Naturally, if a region X contains another region Y then X is bigger than Y.
# Also by definition a region X contains itself.
# 
# Given two regions region1, region2, find out the smallest region that
# contains both of them.
# 
# If you are given regions r1, r2 and r3 such that r1 includes r3, it is
# guaranteed there is no r2 such that r2 includes r3.
# 
# It's guaranteed the smallest region exists.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input:
# regions = [["Earth","North America","South America"],
# ["North America","United States","Canada"],
# ["United States","New York","Boston"],
# ["Canada","Ontario","Quebec"],
# ["South America","Brazil"]],
# region1 = "Quebec",
# region2 = "New York"
# Output: "North America"
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 2 <= regions.length <= 10^4
# region1 != region2
# All strings consist of English letters and spaces with at most 20 letters.
