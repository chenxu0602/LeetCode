#
# Given a 2D grid of 0s and 1s, return the number of elements in the largest
# square subgrid that has all 1s on its border, or 0 if such a subgrid doesn't
# exist in the grid.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: grid = [[1,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,1]]
# Output: 9
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: grid = [[1,1,0,0]]
# Output: 1
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 1 <= grid.length <= 100
# 1 <= grid[0].length <= 100
# grid[i][j] is 0 or 1
