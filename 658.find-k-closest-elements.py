# 
# Given a sorted array, two integers k and x, find the k closest elements to x
# in the array.  The result should also be sorted in ascending order.
# If there is a tie,  the smaller elements are always preferred.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# Input: [1,2,3,4,5], k=4, x=3
# Output: [1,2,3,4]
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# Input: [1,2,3,4,5], k=4, x=-1
# Output: [1,2,3,4]
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# The value k is positive and will always be smaller than the length of the
# sorted array.
# ⁠Length of the given array is positive and will not exceed 10^4
# ⁠Absolute value of elements in the array and x will not exceed 10^4
#

# UPDATE (2017/9/19):
# The arr parameter had been changed to an array of integers (instead of a list
# of integers). Please reload the code definition to get the latest changes.

class Solution:
    def findClosestElements(self, arr: List[int], k: int, x: int) -> List[int]:
        # arr = sorted(arr, key=lambda y: abs(x-y))
        # return sorted(arr[:k])

        # Binary Search and Two Pointers
        # Time  complexity: O(logn + k)
        # Space complexity: O(k)
        left, right = 0, len(arr) - k
        while left < right:
            mid = left + (right - left) // 2
            if x - arr[mid] > arr[mid + k] - x:
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid

        return arr[left:left + k]
