# Given a non-empty 2D array grid of 0's and 1's, an island is a group of 1's
# (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.)  You
# may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.
# 
# Count the number of distinct islands.  An island is considered to be the same
# as another if they have the same shape, or have the same shape after rotation
# (90, 180, or 270 degrees only) or reflection (left/right direction or up/down
# direction).
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 11000
# 10000
# 00001
# 00011
# 
# Given the above grid map, return 1.
# 
# Notice that:
# 
# 11
# 1
# 
# and
# 
# ⁠1
# 11
# 
# are considered same island shapes. Because if we make a 180 degrees clockwise
# rotation on the first island, then two islands will have the same shapes.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 11100
# 10001
# 01001
# 01110
# Given the above grid map, return 2.
# 
# Here are the two distinct islands:
# 
# 111
# 1
# 
# and
# 
# 1
# 1
# 
# 
# Notice that:
# 
# 111
# 1
# 
# and
# 
# 1
# 111
# 
# are considered same island shapes. Because if we flip the first array in the
# up/down direction, then they have the same shapes.
# 
# 
# Note:
# The length of each dimension in the given grid does not exceed 50.
