# Given an array of size n, find the majority element. The majority element is
# the element that appears more than âŒŠ n/2 âŒ‹ times.
# 
# You may assume that the array is non-empty and the majority element always
# exist in the array.

# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: [3,2,3]
# Output: 3
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
# Output: 2
