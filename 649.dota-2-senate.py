#
# In the world of Dota2, there are two parties: the Radiant and the Dire.
# 
# The Dota2 senate consists of senators coming from two parties. Now the senate
# wants to make a decision about a change in the Dota2 game. The voting for
# this change is a round-based procedure. In each round, each senator can
# exercise one of the two rights:
# 
# 
# Ban one senator's right:
# A senator can make another senator lose all his rights in this and all the
# following rounds.
# Announce the victory:
# If this senator found the senators who still have rights to vote are all from
# the same party, he can announce the victory and make the decision about the
# change in the game.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Given a string representing each senator's party belonging. The character 'R'
# and 'D' represent the Radiant party and the Dire party respectively. Then if
# there are n senators, the size of the given string will be n.
# 
# The round-based procedure starts from the first senator to the last senator
# in the given order. This procedure will last until the end of voting. All the
# senators who have lost their rights will be skipped during the procedure.
# 
# Suppose every senator is smart enough and will play the best strategy for his
# own party, you need to predict which party will finally announce the victory
# and make the change in the Dota2 game. The output should be Radiant or Dire.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: "RD"
# Output: "Radiant"
# Explanation: The first senator comes from Radiant and he can just ban the
# next senator's right in the round 1. 
# And the second senator can't exercise any rights any more since his right has
# been banned. 
# And in the round 2, the first senator can just announce the victory since he
# is the only guy in the senate who can vote.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: "RDD"
# Output: "Dire"
# Explanation: 
# The first senator comes from Radiant and he can just ban the next senator's
# right in the round 1. 
# And the second senator can't exercise any rights anymore since his right has
# been banned. 
# And the third senator comes from Dire and he can ban the first senator's
# right in the round 1. 
# And in the round 2, the third senator can just announce the victory since he
# is the only guy in the senate who can vote.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# The length of the given string will in the range [1, 10,000].
