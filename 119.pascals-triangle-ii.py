#
# Given a non-negative index k where k ≤ 33, return the k^th index row of the
# Pascal's triangle.
# 
# Note that the row index starts from 0.
# 
# 
# In Pascal's triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly
# above it.
# 
# Example:
# 
# 
# Input: 3
# Output: [1,3,3,1]
# 
# 
# Follow up:
# 
# Could you optimize your algorithm to use only O(k) extra space?
