#
# A polynomial linked list is a special type of linked list where every node
# represents a term in a polynomial expression.
# 
# Each node has three attributes:
# 
# 
# coefficient: an integer representing the number multiplier of the term. The
# coefficient of the term 9x^4 is 9.
# power: an integer representing the exponent. The power of the term 9x^4 is
# 4.
# next: a pointer to the next node in the list, or null if it is the last node
# of the list.
# 
# 
# For example, the polynomial 5x^3 + 4x - 7 is represented by the polynomial
# linked list illustrated below:
# 
# 
# 
# The polynomial linked list must be in its standard form: the polynomial must
# be in strictly descending order by its power value. Also, terms with a
# coefficient of 0 are omitted.
# 
# Given two polynomial linked list heads, poly1 and poly2, add the polynomials
# together and return the head of the sum of the polynomials.
# 
# PolyNode format:
# 
# The input/output format is as a list of n nodes, where each node is
# represented as its [coefficient, power]. For example, the polynomial 5x^3 +
# 4x - 7 would be represented as: [[5,3],[4,1],[-7,0]].
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Input: poly1 = [[1,1]], poly2 = [[1,0]]
# Output: [[1,1],[1,0]]
# Explanation: poly1 = x. poly2 = 1. The sum is x + 1.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: poly1 = [[2,2],[4,1],[3,0]], poly2 = [[3,2],[-4,1],[-1,0]]
# Output: [[5,2],[2,0]]
# Explanation: poly1 = 2x^2 + 4x + 3. poly2 = 3x^2 - 4x - 1. The sum is 5x^2 +
# 2. Notice that we omit the "0x" term.
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: poly1 = [[1,2]], poly2 = [[-1,2]]
# Output: []
# Explanation: The sum is 0. We return an empty list.
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 0 <= n <= 10^4
# -10^9 <= PolyNode.coefficient <= 10^9
# PolyNode.coefficient != 0
# 0 <= PolyNode.power <= 10^9
# PolyNode.power > PolyNode.next.power
# 
#

# @lc code=start
# Definition for polynomial singly-linked list.
# class PolyNode:
#     def __init__(self, x=0, y=0, next=None):
#         self.coefficient = x
#         self.power = y
#         self.next = next

class Solution:
    def addPoly(self, poly1: 'PolyNode', poly2: 'PolyNode') -> 'PolyNode':
        head = node = PolyNode()
        while poly1 and poly2:
            if poly1.power > poly2.power:
                node.next = node = poly1
                poly1 = poly1.next
            elif poly1.power < poly2.power:
                node.next = node = poly2
                poly2 = poly2.next
            else:
                if coef := poly1.coefficient + poly2.coefficient:
                    node.next = node = PolyNode(coef, poly1.power)
                poly1, poly2 = poly1.next, poly2.next

        node.next = poly1 or poly2
        return head.next
