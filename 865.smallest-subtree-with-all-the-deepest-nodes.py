# Testcase Example:  '[3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4]'
#
# Given a binary tree rooted at root, the depth of each node is the shortest
# distance to the root.
# 
# A node is deepest if it has the largest depth possible amongÂ any node in the
# entire tree.
# 
# The subtree of a node is that node, plus the set of all descendants of that
# node.
# 
# Return the node with the largest depth such that it contains all the deepest
# nodes in its subtree.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4]
# Output: [2,7,4]
# Explanation:
# 
# 
# 
# We return the node with value 2, colored in yellow in the diagram.
# The nodes colored in blue are the deepest nodes of the tree.
# The input "[3, 5, 1, 6, 2, 0, 8, null, null, 7, 4]" is a serialization of the
# given tree.
# The output "[2, 7, 4]" is a serialization of the subtree rooted at the node
# with value 2.
# Both the input and output have TreeNode type.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# The number of nodes in the tree will be between 1 and 500.
# The values of each node are unique.
# 
# 
#
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None
