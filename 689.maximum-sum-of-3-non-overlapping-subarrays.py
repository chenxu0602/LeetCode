#
# In a given array nums of positive integers, find three non-overlapping
# subarrays with maximum sum.
# 
# Each subarray will be of size k, and we want to maximize the sum of all 3*k
# entries.
# 
# Return the result as a list of indices representing the starting position of
# each interval (0-indexed). If there are multiple answers, return the
# lexicographically smallest one.
# 
# Example:
# 
# 
# Input: [1,2,1,2,6,7,5,1], 2
# Output: [0, 3, 5]
# Explanation: Subarrays [1, 2], [2, 6], [7, 5] correspond to the starting
# indices [0, 3, 5].
# We could have also taken [2, 1], but an answer of [1, 3, 5] would be
# lexicographically larger.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# nums.length will be between 1 and 20000.
# nums[i] will be between 1 and 65535.
# k will be between 1 and floor(nums.length / 3).
#
