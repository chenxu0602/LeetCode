#
# 
# Given two strings s and t which consist of only lowercase letters.
# 
# String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more
# letter at a random position.
# 
# Find the letter that was added in t.
# 
# Example:
# 
# Input:
# s = "abcd"
# t = "abcde"
# 
# Output:
# e
# 
# Explanation:
# 'e' is the letter that was added.
