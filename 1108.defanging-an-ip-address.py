# 
# A defangedÂ IP addressÂ replaces every period "." with "[.]".
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# Input: address = "1.1.1.1"
# Output: "1[.]1[.]1[.]1"
# Example 2:
# Input: address = "255.100.50.0"

# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# The given address is a valid IPv4 address.

    def defangIPaddr(self, address: str) -> str:
        return ('[.]'.join(address.split('.')))
