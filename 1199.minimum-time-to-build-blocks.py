#
# You are given a list of blocks, where blocks[i] = t means that the i-th block
# needs t units of time to be built. A block can only be built by exactly one
# worker.
# 
# A worker can either split into two workers (number of workers increases by
# one) or build a block then go home. Both decisions cost some time.
# 
# The time cost of spliting one worker into two workers is given as an integer
# split. Note that if two workers split at the same time, they split in
# parallel so the cost would be split.
# 
# Output the minimum time needed to build all blocks.
# 
# Initially, there is only one worker.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: blocks = [1], split = 1
# Output: 1
# Explanation: We use 1 worker to build 1 block in 1 time unit.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: blocks = [1,2], split = 5
# Output: 7
# Explanation: We split the worker into 2 workers in 5 time units then assign
# each of them to a block so the cost is 5 + max(1, 2) = 7.
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: blocks = [1,2,3], split = 1
# Output: 4
# Explanation: Split 1 worker into 2, then assign the first worker to the last
# block and split the second worker into 2.
# Then, use the two unassigned workers to build the first two blocks.
# The cost is 1 + max(3, 1 + max(1, 2)) = 4.
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 1 <= blocks.length <= 1000
# 1 <= blocks[i] <= 10^5
# 1 <= split <= 100
#
