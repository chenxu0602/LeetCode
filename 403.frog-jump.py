#
# A frog is crossing a river. The river is divided into x units and at each
# unit there may or may not exist a stone. The frog can jump on a stone, but it
# must not jump into the water.
# 
# Given a list of stones' positions (in units) in sorted ascending order,
# determine if the frog is able to cross the river by landing on the last
# stone. Initially, the frog is on the first stone and assume the first jump
# must be 1 unit.
# 
# 
# If the frog's last jump was k units, then its next jump must be either k - 1,
# k, or k + 1 units. Note that the frog can only jump in the forward
# direction.
# 
# Note:
# 
# The number of stones is â‰¥ 2 and is < 1,100.
# Each stone's position will be a non-negative integer < 2^31.
# The first stone's position is always 0.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# [0,1,3,5,6,8,12,17]
# 
# There are a total of 8 stones.
# The first stone at the 0th unit, second stone at the 1st unit,
# third stone at the 3rd unit, and so on...
# The last stone at the 17th unit.
# 
# Return true. The frog can jump to the last stone by jumping 
# 1 unit to the 2nd stone, then 2 units to the 3rd stone, then 
# 2 units to the 4th stone, then 3 units to the 6th stone, 
# 4 units to the 7th stone, and 5 units to the 8th stone.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# [0,1,2,3,4,8,9,11]
# 
# Return false. There is no way to jump to the last stone as 
# the gap between the 5th and 6th stone is too large.
