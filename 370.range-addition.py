# Testcase Example:  '5\n[[1,3,2],[2,4,3],[0,2,-2]]'
#
# Assume you have an array of length n initialized with all 0's and are given k
# update operations.
# 
# Each operation is represented as a triplet: [startIndex, endIndex, inc] which
# increments each element of subarray A[startIndex ... endIndex] (startIndex
# and endIndex inclusive) with inc.
# 
# Return the modified array after all k operations were executed.
# 
# Example:
# 
# 
# Input: length = 5, updates = [[1,3,2],[2,4,3],[0,2,-2]]
# Output: [-2,0,3,5,3]
# 
# 
# Explanation:
# 
# 
# Initial state:
# [0,0,0,0,0]
# 
# After applying operation [1,3,2]:
# [0,2,2,2,0]
# 
# After applying operation [2,4,3]:
# [0,2,5,5,3]
# 
# After applying operation [0,2,-2]:
# [-2,0,3,5,3]
# 
#
class Solution:
    def getModifiedArray(self, length: int, updates: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        res = [0] * (length + 1)
        for upd in updates:
            start, end, inc = upd
            res[start] += inc
            res[end+1] -= inc

        for i in range(1, length+1):
            res[i] += res[i-1]

        return res[:-1]
