#
# 
# There is a list of sorted integers from 1 to n. Starting from left to right,
# remove the first number and every other number afterward until you reach the
# end of the list.
# 
# Repeat the previous step again, but this time from right to left, remove the
# right most number and every other number from the remaining numbers.
# 
# We keep repeating the steps again, alternating left to right and right to
# left, until a single number remains.
# 
# Find the last number that remains starting with a list of length n.
# 
# Example:
# 
# Input:
# n = 9,
# 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
# 2 4 6 8
# 2 6
# 6
# 
# Output:
# 6

class Solution:
    def lastRemaining(self, n: int) -> int:

        arr = range(1, n + 1)
        while len(arr) > 1:
            arr = arr[1::2][::-1]
        return arr[0]
