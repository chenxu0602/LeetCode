# Testcase Example:  '[[2,1,1],[1,1,0],[0,1,1]]'
#
# In a given grid, each cell can have one of three values:
# 
# 
# the value 0 representing an empty cell;
# the value 1 representing a fresh orange;
# the value 2 representing a rotten orange.
# 
# 
# Every minute, any fresh orange that is adjacent (4-directionally) to a rotten
# orange becomes rotten.
# 
# Return the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a
# fresh orange.  If this is impossible, return -1 instead.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Input: [[2,1,1],[1,1,0],[0,1,1]]
# Output: 4
# 
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: [[2,1,1],[0,1,1],[1,0,1]]
# Output: -1
# Explanation:  The orange in the bottom left corner (row 2, column 0) is never
# rotten, because rotting only happens 4-directionally.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: [[0,2]]
# Output: 0
# Explanation:  Since there are already no fresh oranges at minute 0, the
# answer is just 0.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# 1 <= grid.length <= 10
# 1 <= grid[0].length <= 10
# grid[i][j] is only 0, 1, or 2.
#
