#
# With respect to a given puzzle string, a word is valid if both the following
# conditions are satisfied:
# 
# word contains the first letter of puzzle.
# For each letter in word, that letter is in puzzle.
# For example, if the puzzle is "abcdefg", then valid words are "faced",
# "cabbage", and "baggage"; while invalid words are "beefed" (doesn't include
# "a") and "based" (includes "s" which isn't in the puzzle).
# 
# Return an array answer, where answer[i] is the number of words in the given
# word list words that are valid with respect to the puzzle puzzles[i].
# 
# Example :
# 
# 
# Input: 
# words = ["aaaa","asas","able","ability","actt","actor","access"], 
# puzzles = ["aboveyz","abrodyz","abslute","absoryz","actresz","gaswxyz"]
# Output: [1,1,3,2,4,0]
# Explanation:
# 1 valid word for "aboveyz" : "aaaa" 
# 1 valid word for "abrodyz" : "aaaa"
# 3 valid words for "abslute" : "aaaa", "asas", "able"
# 2 valid words for "absoryz" : "aaaa", "asas"
# 4 valid words for "actresz" : "aaaa", "asas", "actt", "access"
# There're no valid words for "gaswxyz" cause none of the words in the list
# contains letter 'g'.
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 1 <= words.length <= 10^5
# 4 <= words[i].length <= 50
# 1 <= puzzles.length <= 10^4
# puzzles[i].length == 7
# words[i][j], puzzles[i][j] are English lowercase letters.
# Each puzzles[i] doesn't contain repeated characters.
