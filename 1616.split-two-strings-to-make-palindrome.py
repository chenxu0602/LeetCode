# Testcase Example:  '"x"\n"y"'
#
# You are given two strings a and b of the same length. Choose an index and
# split both strings at the same index, splitting a into two strings: aprefix
# and asuffix where a = aprefix + asuffix, and splitting b into two strings:
# bprefix and bsuffix where b = bprefix + bsuffix. Check if aprefix + bsuffix
# or bprefix + asuffix forms a palindrome.
# 
# When you split a string s into sprefix and ssuffix, either ssuffix or sprefix
# is allowed to be empty. For example, if s = "abc", then "" + "abc", "a" +
# "bc", "ab" + "c" , and "abc" + "" are valid splits.
# 
# Return true if it is possible to form a palindrome string, otherwise return
# false.
# 
# Notice thatÂ x + y denotes the concatenation of strings x and y.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: a = "x", b = "y"
# Output: true
# Explaination: If either a or b are palindromes the answer is true since you
# can split in the following way:
# aprefix = "", asuffix = "x"
# bprefix = "", bsuffix = "y"
# Then, aprefix + bsuffix = "" + "y" = "y", which is a palindrome.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: a = "abdef", b = "fecab"
# Output: true
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: a = "ulacfd", b = "jizalu"
# Output: true
# Explaination: Split them at index 3:
# aprefix = "ula", asuffix = "cfd"
# bprefix = "jiz", bsuffix = "alu"
# Then, aprefix + bsuffix = "ula" + "alu" = "ulaalu", which is a palindrome.
# 
# 
# Example 4:
# 
# 
# Input: a = "xbdef", b = "xecab"
# Output: false
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 1 <= a.length, b.length <= 10^5
# a.length == b.length
# a and b consist of lowercase English letters
# 
#
