#
# You are given K eggs, and you have access to a building with N floors from 1
# to N. 
# 
# Each egg is identical in function, and if an egg breaks, you cannot drop it
# again.
# 
# You know that there exists a floor F with 0 <= F <= N such that any egg
# dropped at a floor higher than F will break, and any egg dropped at or below
# floor F will not break.
# 
# Each move, you may take an egg (if you have an unbroken one) and drop it from
# any floor X (with 1 <= X <= N). 
# 
# Your goal is to know with certainty what the value of F is.
# 
# What is the minimum number of moves that you need to know with certainty what
# F is, regardless of the initial value of F?
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: K = 1, N = 2
# Output: 2
# Explanation: 
# Drop the egg from floor 1.  If it breaks, we know with certainty that F = 0.
# Otherwise, drop the egg from floor 2.  If it breaks, we know with certainty
# that F = 1.
# If it didn't break, then we know with certainty F = 2.
# Hence, we needed 2 moves in the worst case to know what F is with
# certainty.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: K = 2, N = 6
# Output: 3
# 
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: K = 3, N = 14
# Output: 4
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# 1 <= K <= 100
# 1 <= N <= 10000

        # Dynamic Programming with Binary Search
        # K eggs and N floors left. When we drop an egg from floor X, it either survives and we have state (K, N-X), or it breaks and we have state (K-1, X-1).
        # This approach would lead to a O(K x N^2) algorithm, but this is not efficient enough for the given constraints. 
        # dp(K-1, X-1) is an increasing function on X while dp(K, N-X) is a decreasing function on X.
        # dp(K, N) = min_{1<=X<=N} (max(dp(K-1, X-1), dp(K, N-X))) means we don't need to check every X to find the minimum.

        #         # Notice max(dp[x-1], dp2[n-x]) > max(dp[x], dp2[n-x-1])
