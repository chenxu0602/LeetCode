# Testcase Example:  '[-10,-3,0,5,9]'
#
# Given a singly linked list where elements are sorted in ascending order,
# convert it to a height balanced BST.
# 
# For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree
# in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more
# than 1.
# 
# Example:
# 
# 
# Given the sorted linked list: [-10,-3,0,5,9],
# 
# One possible answer is: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the following
# height balanced BST:
# 
# ⁠     0
# ⁠    / \
# ⁠  -3   9
# ⁠  /   /
# ⁠-10  5
#

# @lc code=start
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    def sortedListToBST(self, head: ListNode) -> TreeNode:

        if not head: return None
        if not head.next: return TreeNode(head.val)

        slow, fast = head, head.next.next
        while fast and fast.next:
            slow, fast = slow.next, fast.next.next

        mid = slow.next
        slow.next = None

        root = TreeNode(mid.val)
        root.left = self.sortedListToBST(head)
        root.right = self.sortedListToBST(mid.next)

        return root
