# Testcase Example:  '["tars","rats","arts","star"]'
#
# Two strings X and Y are similar if we can swap two letters (in different
# positions) of X, so that it equals Y.
# 
# For example, "tars" and "rats" are similar (swapping at positions 0 and 2),
# and "rats" and "arts" are similar, but "star" is not similar to "tars",
# "rats", or "arts".
# 
# Together, these form two connected groups by similarity: {"tars", "rats",
# "arts"} and {"star"}.  Notice that "tars" and "arts" are in the same group
# even though they are not similar.  Formally, each group is such that a word
# is in the group if and only if it is similar to at least one other word in
# the group.
# 
# We are given a list A of strings.  Every string in A is an anagram of every
# other string in A.  How many groups are there?
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: ["tars","rats","arts","star"]
# Output: 2
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# A.length <= 2000
# A[i].length <= 1000
# A.length * A[i].length <= 20000
# All words in A consist of lowercase letters only.
# All words in A have the same length and are anagrams of each other.
# The judging time limit has been increased for this question.
