#
# A string of '0's and '1's is monotone increasing if it consists of some
# number of '0's (possibly 0), followed by some number of '1's (also possibly
# 0.)
# 
# We are given a string S of '0's and '1's, and we may flip any '0' to a '1' or
# a '1' to a '0'.
# 
# Return the minimum number of flips to make SÂ monotone increasing.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: "00110"
# Output: 1
# Explanation: We flip the last digit to get 00111.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: "010110"
# Output: 2
# Explanation: We flip to get 011111, or alternatively 000111.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: "00011000"
# Output: 2
# Explanation: We flip to get 00000000.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# 1 <= S.length <= 20000
# S only consists of '0' and '1' characters.

class Solution:
    def minFlipsMonoIncr(self, S: str) -> int:
        P = [0]
        for x in S:
            P.append(P[-1] + int(x))

        return min(P[j] + len(S)-j - (P[-1] - P[j]) for j in range(len(P)))
