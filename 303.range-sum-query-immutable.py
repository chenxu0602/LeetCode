#
# Given an integer array nums, find the sum of the elements between indices i
# and j (i â‰¤ j), inclusive.
# 
# Example:
# 
# Given nums = [-2, 0, 3, -5, 2, -1]
# 
# sumRange(0, 2) -> 1
# sumRange(2, 5) -> -1
# sumRange(0, 5) -> -3
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# You may assume that the array does not change.
# There are many calls to sumRange function.
#

    def __init__(self, nums: List[int]):
        self.lists = [0] * (len(nums) + 1)
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            self.lists[i+1] = self.lists[i] + nums[i]

    def sumRange(self, i: int, j: int) -> int:
        return self.lists[j+1] - self.lists[i]
        


# Your NumArray object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = NumArray(nums)
# param_1 = obj.sumRange(i,j)
