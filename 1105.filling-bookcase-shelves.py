#
# We have a sequence of books: the i-th book has thickness books[i][0] and
# height books[i][1].
# 
# We want to place these books in order onto bookcase shelves that have total
# width shelf_width.
# 
# We choose some of the books to place on this shelf (such that the sum of
# their thickness is <= shelf_width), then build another level of shelf of the
# bookcase so that the total height of the bookcase has increased by the
# maximum height of the books we just put down.  We repeat this process until
# there are no more books to place.
# 
# Note again that at each step of the above process, the order of the books we
# place is the same order as the given sequence of books.  For example, if we
# have an ordered list of 5 books, we might place the first and second book
# onto the first shelf, the third book on the second shelf, and the fourth and
# fifth book on the last shelf.
# 
# Return the minimum possible height that the total bookshelf can be after
# placing shelves in this manner.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: books = [[1,1],[2,3],[2,3],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,2]], shelf_width = 4
# Output: 6
# Explanation:
# The sum of the heights of the 3 shelves are 1 + 3 + 2 = 6.
# Notice that book number 2 does not have to be on the first shelf.
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 1 <= books.length <= 1000
# 1 <= books[i][0] <= shelf_width <= 1000
# 1 <= books[i][1] <= 1000
#

class Solution:
    def minHeightShelves(self, books: List[List[int]], shelf_width: int) -> int:
        dp = [0]
        for i in range(len(books)):
            w, j = books[i][0], i
            while j >= 0 and w <= shelf_width:
                j -= 1
                w += books[j][0]

            dp.append(min(dp[k] + max(books[x][1] for x in range(k, i + 1)) for k in range(j + 1, i + 1)))

        return dp[-1]
