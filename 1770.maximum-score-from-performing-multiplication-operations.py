# Testcase Example:  '[1,2,3]\n[3,2,1]'
#
# You are given two integer arrays nums and multipliers of size n and m
# respectively, where n >= m. The arrays are 1-indexed.
# 
# You begin with a score of 0. You want to perform exactly m operations. On the
# i^th operation (1-indexed), you will:
# 
# 
# Choose one integer x from either the start or the end of the array nums.
# Add multipliers[i] * x to your score.
# Remove x from the array nums.
# 
# 
# Return the maximum score after performing m operations.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: nums = [1,2,3], multipliers = [3,2,1]
# Output: 14
# Explanation:Â An optimal solution is as follows:
# - Choose from the end, [1,2,3], adding 3 * 3 = 9 to the score.
# - Choose from the end, [1,2], adding 2 * 2 = 4 to the score.
# - Choose from the end, [1], adding 1 * 1 = 1 to the score.
# The total score is 9 + 4 + 1 = 14.
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: nums = [-5,-3,-3,-2,7,1], multipliers = [-10,-5,3,4,6]
# Output: 102
# Explanation: An optimal solution is as follows:
# - Choose from the start, [-5,-3,-3,-2,7,1], adding -5 * -10 = 50 to the
# score.
# - Choose from the start, [-3,-3,-2,7,1], adding -3 * -5 = 15 to the score.
# - Choose from the start, [-3,-2,7,1], adding -3 * 3 = -9 to the score.
# - Choose from the end, [-2,7,1], adding 1 * 4 = 4 to the score.
# - Choose from the end, [-2,7], adding 7 * 6 = 42 to the score. 
# The total score is 50 + 15 - 9 + 4 + 42 = 102.
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# n == nums.length
# m == multipliers.length
# 1 <= m <= 10^3
# m <= n <= 10^5 
# -1000 <= nums[i], multipliers[i] <= 1000
#
