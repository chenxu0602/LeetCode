#
# We are given a binary tree (with root node root), a target node, and an
# integer value K.
# 
# Return a list of the values of all nodes that have a distance K from the
# target node.  The answer can be returned in any order.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], target = 5, K = 2
# 
# Output: [7,4,1]
# 
# Explanation: 
# The nodes that are a distance 2 from the target node (with value 5)
# have values 7, 4, and 1.
# 
# 
# 
# Note that the inputs "root" and "target" are actually TreeNodes.
# The descriptions of the inputs above are just serializations of these
# objects.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# The given tree is non-empty.
# Each node in the tree has unique values 0 <= node.val <= 500.
# The target node is a node in the tree.
# 0 <= K <= 1000.
# 
# 
# 
#
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None
