#
# Convert a Binary Search Tree to a sorted Circular Doubly-Linked List in
# place.
# 
# You can think of the left and right pointers as synonymous to the predecessor
# and successor pointers in a doubly-linked list. For a circular doubly linked
# list, the predecessor of the first element is the last element, and the
# successor of the last element is the first element.
# 
# We want to do the transformation in place. After the transformation, the left
# pointer of the tree node should point to its predecessor, and the right
# pointer should point to its successor. You should return the pointer to the
# smallest element of the linked list.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Input: root = [4,2,5,1,3]
# 
# 
# Output: [1,2,3,4,5]
# 
# Explanation: The figure below shows the transformed BST. The solid line
# indicates the successor relationship, while the dashed line means the
# predecessor relationship.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: root = [2,1,3]
# Output: [1,2,3]
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: root = []
# Output: []
# Explanation: Input is an empty tree. Output is also an empty Linked List.
# 
# 
# Example 4:
# 
# 
# Input: root = [1]
# Output: [1]
#

# Constraints:
# 
# 
# -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
# Node.left.val < Node.val < Node.right.val
# All values of Node.val are unique.
# 0 <= Number of Nodes <= 2000
