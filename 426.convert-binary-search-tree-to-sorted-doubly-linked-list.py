# Convert a BST to a sorted circular doubly-linked list in-place. Think of the
# left and right pointers as synonymous to the previous and next pointers in a
# doubly-linked list.
# 
# Let's take the following BST as an example, it may help you understand the
# problem better:
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 
# We want to transform this BST into a circular doubly linked list. Each node
# in a doubly linked list has a predecessor and successor. For a circular
# doubly linked list, the predecessor of the first element is the last element,
# and the successor of the last element is the first element.
# 
# The figure below shows the circular doubly linked list for the BST above. The
# "head" symbol means the node it points to is the smallest element of the
# linked list.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Specifically, we want to do the transformation in place. After the
# transformation, the left pointer of the tree node should point to its
# predecessor, and the right pointer should point to its successor. We should
# return the pointer to the first element of the linked list.
# 
# The figure below shows the transformed BST. The solid line indicates the
# successor relationship, while the dashed line means the predecessor
# relationship.
