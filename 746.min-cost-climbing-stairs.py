# 
# On a staircase, the i-th step has some non-negative cost cost[i] assigned (0
# indexed).
# 
# Once you pay the cost, you can either climb one or two steps. You need to
# find minimum cost to reach the top of the floor, and you can either start
# from the step with index 0, or the step with index 1.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# Input: cost = [10, 15, 20]
# Output: 15
# Explanation: Cheapest is start on cost[1], pay that cost and go to the
# top.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# Input: cost = [1, 100, 1, 1, 1, 100, 1, 1, 100, 1]
# Output: 6
# Explanation: Cheapest is start on cost[0], and only step on 1s, skipping
# cost[3].
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# cost will have a length in the range [2, 1000].
# Every cost[i] will be an integer in the range [0, 999].

class Solution:
    def minCostClimbingStairs(self, cost: List[int]) -> int:
        a, b = cost[0], cost[1]
        for i in range(2, len(cost)):
            a, b = b, min(a, b) + cost[i]
        return min(a,b)

        # f1 = f2 = 0
        # for x in reversed(cost):
        #     f1, f2 = x + min(f1, f2), f1
        # return min(f1, f2)
