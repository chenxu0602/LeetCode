#
# Given a list accounts, each element accounts[i] is a list of strings, where
# the first element accounts[i][0] is a name, and the rest of the elements are
# emails representing emails of the account.
# 
# Now, we would like to merge these accounts.  Two accounts definitely belong
# to the same person if there is some email that is common to both accounts.
# Note that even if two accounts have the same name, they may belong to
# different people as people could have the same name.  A person can have any
# number of accounts initially, but all of their accounts definitely have the
# same name.
# 
# After merging the accounts, return the accounts in the following format: the
# first element of each account is the name, and the rest of the elements are
# emails in sorted order.  The accounts themselves can be returned in any
# order.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# Input: 
# accounts = [["John", "johnsmith@mail.com", "john00@mail.com"], ["John",
# "johnnybravo@mail.com"], ["John", "johnsmith@mail.com",
# "john_newyork@mail.com"], ["Mary", "mary@mail.com"]]
# Output: [["John", 'john00@mail.com', 'john_newyork@mail.com',
# 'johnsmith@mail.com'],  ["John", "johnnybravo@mail.com"], ["Mary",
# "mary@mail.com"]]
# Explanation: 
# The first and third John's are the same person as they have the common email
# "johnsmith@mail.com".
# The second John and Mary are different people as none of their email
# addresses are used by other accounts.
# We could return these lists in any order, for example the answer [['Mary',
# 'mary@mail.com'], ['John', 'johnnybravo@mail.com'], 
# ['John', 'john00@mail.com', 'john_newyork@mail.com', 'johnsmith@mail.com']]
# would still be accepted.
# 
# 
# 
# Note:

# The length of accounts will be in the range [1, 1000].
# The length of accounts[i] will be in the range [1, 10].
# The length of accounts[i][j] will be in the range [1, 30].
