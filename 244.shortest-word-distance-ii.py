#
# Design a class which receives a list of words in the constructor, and
# implements a method that takes two words word1 and word2 and return the
# shortest distance between these two words in the list. Your method will be
# called repeatedly many times with different parameters. 
# 
# Example:
# Assume that words = ["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"].
# 
# 
# Input: word1 = “coding”, word2 = “practice”
# Output: 3
# 
# 
# 
# Input: word1 = "makes", word2 = "coding"
# Output: 1
# 
# Note:
# You may assume that word1 does not equal to word2, and word1 and word2 are
# both in the list.
