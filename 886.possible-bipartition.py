# Testcase Example:  '4\n[[1,2],[1,3],[2,4]]'
#
# Given a set of N people (numbered 1, 2, ..., N), we would like to split
# everyone into two groups of any size.
# 
# Each person may dislike some other people, and they should not go into the
# same group. 
# 
# Formally, if dislikes[i] = [a, b], it means it is not allowed to put the
# people numbered a and b into the same group.
# 
# Return true if and only if it is possible to split everyone into two groups
# in this way.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: N = 4, dislikes = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,4]]
# Output: true
# Explanation: group1 [1,4], group2 [2,3]
# 
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: N = 3, dislikes = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]]
# Output: false
# 
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: N = 5, dislikes = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5],[1,5]]
# Output: false
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# 1 <= N <= 2000
# 0 <= dislikes.length <= 10000
# 1 <= dislikes[i][j] <= N
# dislikes[i][0] < dislikes[i][1]
# There does not exist i != j for which dislikes[i] == dislikes[j].
