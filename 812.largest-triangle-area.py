# Testcase Example:  '[[0,0],[0,1],[1,0],[0,2],[2,0]]'
#
# You have a list of points in the plane. Return the area of the largest
# triangle that can be formed by any 3 of the points.
# 
# 
# Example:
# Input: points = [[0,0],[0,1],[1,0],[0,2],[2,0]]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: 
# The five points are show in the figure below. The red triangle is the
# largest.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Notes: 
# 
# 
# 3 <= points.length <= 50.
# No points will be duplicated.
# -50 <= points[i][j] <= 50.
# Answers within 10^-6 of the true value will be accepted as correct.
