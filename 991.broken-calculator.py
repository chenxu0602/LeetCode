#
# On a broken calculator that has a number showing on its display, we can
# perform two operations:
# 
# 
# Double: Multiply the number on the display by 2, or;
# Decrement: Subtract 1 from the number on the display.
# 
# 
# Initially, the calculator is displaying the number X.
# 
# Return the minimum number of operations needed to display the number Y.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: X = 2, Y = 3
# Output: 2
# Explanation: Use double operation and then decrement operation {2 -> 4 ->
# 3}.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: X = 5, Y = 8
# Output: 2
# Explanation: Use decrement and then double {5 -> 4 -> 8}.
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: X = 3, Y = 10
# Output: 3
# Explanation:  Use double, decrement and double {3 -> 6 -> 5 -> 10}.
# 
# 
# Example 4:
# 
# 
# Input: X = 1024, Y = 1
# Output: 1023
# Explanation: Use decrement operations 1023 times.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# 1 <= X <= 10^9
# 1 <= Y <= 10^9
# 
#
class Solution:
    def brokenCalc(self, X: int, Y: int) -> int:
        ans = 0
        while Y > X:
            ans += 1
            if Y % 2:
                Y += 1
            else:
                Y //= 2

        return ans + (X - Y)
