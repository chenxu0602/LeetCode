#
# Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.
# 
# Initially, there are n stones in a pile.  On each player's turn, that player
# makes a move consisting of removing any non-zero square number of stones in
# the pile.
# 
# Also, if a player cannot make a move, he/she loses the game.
# 
# Given a positive integer n. Return True if and only if Alice wins the game
# otherwise return False, assuming both players play optimally.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: n = 1
# Output: true
# Explanation: Alice can remove 1 stone winning the game because Bob doesn't
# have any moves.
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: n = 2
# Output: false
# Explanation: Alice can only remove 1 stone, after that Bob removes the last
# one winning the game (2 -> 1 -> 0).
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: n = 4
# Output: true
# Explanation: n is already a perfect square, Alice can win with one move,
# removing 4 stones (4 -> 0).
# 
# 
# Example 4:
# 
# 
# Input: n = 7
# Output: false
# Explanation: Alice can't win the game if Bob plays optimally.
# If Alice starts removing 4 stones, Bob will remove 1 stone then Alice should
# remove only 1 stone and finally Bob removes the last one (7 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 ->
# 0). 
# If Alice starts removing 1 stone, Bob will remove 4 stones then Alice only
# can remove 1 stone and finally Bob removes the last one (7 -> 6 -> 2 -> 1 ->
# 0).
# 
# Example 5:
# 
# 
# Input: n = 17
# Output: false
# Explanation: Alice can't win the game if Bob plays optimally.
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 1 <= n <= 10^5
#
