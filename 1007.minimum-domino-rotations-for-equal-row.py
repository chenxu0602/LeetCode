#
# In a row of dominoes, A[i] and B[i] represent the top and bottom halves of
# the i-th domino.  (A domino is a tile with two numbers from 1 to 6 - one on
# each half of the tile.)
# 
# We may rotate the i-th domino, so that A[i] and B[i] swap values.
# 
# Return the minimum number of rotations so that all the values in A are the
# same, or all the values in B are the same.
# 
# If it cannot be done, return -1.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Input: A = [2,1,2,4,2,2], B = [5,2,6,2,3,2]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: 
# The first figure represents the dominoes as given by A and B: before we do
# any rotations.
# If we rotate the second and fourth dominoes, we can make every value in the
# top row equal to 2, as indicated by the second figure.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: A = [3,5,1,2,3], B = [3,6,3,3,4]
# Output: -1
# Explanation: 
# In this case, it is not possible to rotate the dominoes to make one row of
# values equal.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# 1 <= A[i], B[i] <= 6
# 2 <= A.length == B.length <= 20000
# 
# 
#
class Solution:
    def minDominoRotations(self, A: List[int], B: List[int]) -> int:
        candidates = set([A[0]] + [B[0]])

        for i in range(1, len(A)):
            next_col = set([A[i]] + [B[i]])
            candidates = candidates.intersection(next_col)
            if not candidates:
                return -1

        res = float("inf")
        for cand in candidates:
            top, bottom = 0, 0
            for i in range(len(A)):
                top += A[i] == cand
                bottom += B[i] == cand
            res = min(res, len(A) - max(top, bottom))
        return res
