#
# Given n balloons, indexed from 0 to n-1. Each balloon is painted with a
# number on it represented by array nums. You are asked to burst all the
# balloons. If the you burst balloon i you will get nums[left] * nums[i] *
# nums[right] coins. Here left and right are adjacent indices of i. After the
# burst, the left and right then becomes adjacent.
# 
# Find the maximum coins you can collect by bursting the balloons wisely.
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# You may imagine nums[-1] = nums[n] = 1. They are not real therefore you can
# not burst them.
# 0 ≤ n ≤ 500, 0 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 100
# 
# 
# Example:
# 
# 
# Input: [3,1,5,8]
# Output: 167 
# Explanation: nums = [3,1,5,8] --> [3,5,8] -->   [3,8]   -->  [8]  -->
# []
# coins =  3*1*5      +  3*5*8    +  1*3*8      + 1*8*1   = 167
