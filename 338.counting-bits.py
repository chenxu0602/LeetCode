# Testcase Example:  '2'
#
# Given a non negative integer number num. For every numbers i in the range 0 â‰¤
# i â‰¤ num calculate the number of 1's in their binary representation and return
# them as an array.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: 2
# Output: [0,1,1]
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: 5
# Output: [0,1,1,2,1,2]
# 
# 
# Follow up:
# 
# 
# It is very easy to come up with a solution with run time
# O(n*sizeof(integer)). But can you do it in linear time O(n) /possibly in a
# single pass?
# Space complexity should be O(n).
# Can you do it like a boss? Do it without using any builtin function like
# __builtin_popcount in c++ or in any other language.
