#
# Design a search autocomplete system for a search engine. Users may input a
# sentence (at least one word and end with a special character '#'). For each
# character they type except '#', you need to return the top 3 historical hot
# sentences that have prefix the same as the part of sentence already typed.
# Here are the specific rules:
# 
# 
# The hot degree for a sentence is defined as the number of times a user typed
# the exactly same sentence before.
# The returned top 3 hot sentences should be sorted by hot degree (The first is
# the hottest one). If several sentences have the same degree of hot, you need
# to use ASCII-code order (smaller one appears first).
# If less than 3 hot sentences exist, then just return as many as you can.
# When the input is a special character, it means the sentence ends, and in
# this case, you need to return an empty list.
# 
# 
# Your job is to implement the following functions:
# 
# The constructor function:
# 
# AutocompleteSystem(String[] sentences, int[] times): This is the constructor.
# The input is historical data. Sentences is a string array consists of
# previously typed sentences. Times is the corresponding times a sentence has
# been typed. Your system should record these historical data.
# 
# Now, the user wants to input a new sentence. The following function will
# provide the next character the user types:
# 
# List<String> input(char c): The input c is the next character typed by the
# user. The character will only be lower-case letters ('a' to 'z'), blank space
# (' ') or a special character ('#'). Also, the previously typed sentence
# should be recorded in your system. The output will be the top 3 historical
# hot sentences that have prefix the same as the part of sentence already
# typed.
# 
# 
# Example:
# Operation: AutocompleteSystem(["i love you", "island","ironman", "i love
# leetcode"], [5,3,2,2])
# The system have already tracked down the following sentences and their
# corresponding times:
# "i love you" : 5 times
# "island" : 3 times
# "ironman" : 2 times
# "i love leetcode" : 2 times
# Now, the user begins another search:
# 
# Operation: input('i')
# Output: ["i love you", "island","i love leetcode"]
# Explanation:
# There are four sentences that have prefix "i". Among them, "ironman" and "i
# love leetcode" have same hot degree. Since ' ' has ASCII code 32 and 'r' has
# ASCII code 114, "i love leetcode" should be in front of "ironman". Also we
# only need to output top 3 hot sentences, so "ironman" will be ignored.
# 
# Operation: input(' ')
# Output: ["i love you","i love leetcode"]
# Explanation:
# There are only two sentences that have prefix "i ".
# 
# Operation: input('a')
# Output: []
# Explanation:
# There are no sentences that have prefix "i a".
# 
# Operation: input('#')
# Output: []
# Explanation:
# The user finished the input, the sentence "i a" should be saved as a
# historical sentence in system. And the following input will be counted as a
# new search.
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# The input sentence will always start with a letter and end with '#', and only
# one blank space will exist between two words.
# The number of complete sentences that to be searched won't exceed 100. The
# length of each sentence including those in the historical data won't exceed
# 100.
# Please use double-quote instead of single-quote when you write test cases
# even for a character input.
# Please remember to RESET your class variables declared in class
# AutocompleteSystem, as static/class variables are persisted across multiple
# test cases. Please see here for more details.
