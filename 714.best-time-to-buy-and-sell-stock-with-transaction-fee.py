#
# Your are given an array of integers prices, for which the i-th element is the
# price of a given stock on day i; and a non-negative integer fee representing
# a transaction fee.
# You may complete as many transactions as you like, but you need to pay the
# transaction fee for each transaction.  You may not buy more than 1 share of a
# stock at a time (ie. you must sell the stock share before you buy again.)
# Return the maximum profit you can make.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# Input: prices = [1, 3, 2, 8, 4, 9], fee = 2
# Output: 8
# Explanation: The maximum profit can be achieved by:
# Buying at prices[0] = 1Selling at prices[3] = 8Buying at prices[4] = 4Selling
# at prices[5] = 9The total profit is ((8 - 1) - 2) + ((9 - 4) - 2) = 8.
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 0 < prices.length .
# 0 < prices[i] < 50000.
# 0 .

class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int], fee: int) -> int:
        # O(N)

        # dp = [[0] * 2 for _ in range(len(prices))]
        # dp[0][0] = 0
        # dp[0][1] = -prices[0]

        # for i in range(1, len(prices)):
        #     dp[i][1] = max(dp[i-1][0] - prices[i], dp[i-1][1])
        #     dp[i][0] = max(dp[i-1][1] + prices[i] - fee, dp[i-1][0])

        # return dp[-1][0]


        # cash, hold = 0, -prices[0]
        # for i in range(1, len(prices)):
        #     cash = max(cash, hold + prices[i] - fee)
        #     hold = max(hold, cash - prices[i])
        # return cash


        n = len(prices)
        if n < 2: return 0

        ans = 0
        minimum = float("inf")
        for p in prices:
            minimum = min(minimum, p)
            if p > minimum + fee:
                ans += p - minimum - fee
                minimum = p - fee
        return ans
