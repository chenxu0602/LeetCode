#
# You have a list of words and a pattern, and you want to know which words in
# words matches the pattern.
# 
# A word matches the pattern if there exists a permutation of letters p so that
# after replacing every letter x in the pattern with p(x), we get the desired
# word.
# 
# (Recall that a permutation of letters is a bijection from letters to letters:
# every letter maps to another letter, and no two letters map to the same
# letter.)
# 
# Return a list of the words in words that match the given pattern. 
# 
# You may return the answer in any order.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: words = ["abc","deq","mee","aqq","dkd","ccc"], pattern = "abb"
# Output: ["mee","aqq"]
# Explanation: "mee" matches the pattern because there is a permutation {a ->
# m, b -> e, ...}. 
# "ccc" does not match the pattern because {a -> c, b -> c, ...} is not a
# permutation,
# since a and b map to the same letter.
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# 1 <= words.length <= 50
# 1 <= pattern.length = words[i].length <= 20
# 
# 
# 
#
class Solution:
    def findAndReplacePattern(self, words: List[str], pattern: str) -> List[str]:
        return [word for word in words
                if len(word) == len(pattern) and
                len(set(word)) == len(set(pattern)) and
                len(set(zip(word, pattern))) == len(set(word))]
