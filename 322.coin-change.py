#
# You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money
# amount. Write a function to compute the fewest number of coins that you need
# to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any
# combination of the coins, return -1.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: coins = [1, 2, 5], amount = 11
# Output: 3 
# Explanation: 11 = 5 + 5 + 1
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: coins = [2], amount = 3
# Output: -1
# 
# 
# Note:
# You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.

class Solution:
    def coinChange(self, coins: List[int], amount: int) -> int:

        # dp = [0] + [float("inf")] * amount
        # for i in range(1, amount + 1):
        #     dp[i] = 1 + min(dp[i-c] if i - c >= 0 else float("inf") for c in coins)
        # return [dp[-1], -1][dp[-1] == float("inf")]

        dp = [float("inf")] * (amount + 1)
        dp[0] = 0

        for coin in coins:
            for x in range(coin, amount + 1):
                dp[x] = min(dp[x], dp[x - coin] + 1)
        return dp[amount] if dp[amount] != float("inf") else -1
