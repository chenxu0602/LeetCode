#
# Alex and Lee continue their games with piles of stones.  There are a number
# of piles arranged in a row, and each pile has a positive integer number of
# stones piles[i].  The objective of the game is to end with the most stones. 
# 
# Alex and Lee take turns, with Alex starting first.  Initially, M = 1.
# 
# On each player's turn, that player can take all the stones in the first X
# remaining piles, where 1 <= X <= 2M.  Then, we set M = max(M, X).
# 
# The game continues until all the stones have been taken.
# 
# Assuming Alex and Lee play optimally, return the maximum number of stones
# Alex can get.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: piles = [2,7,9,4,4]
# Output: 10
# Explanation:  If Alex takes one pile at the beginning, Lee takes two piles,
# then Alex takes 2 piles again. Alex can get 2 + 4 + 4 = 10 piles in total. If
# Alex takes two piles at the beginning, then Lee can take all three piles
# left. In this case, Alex get 2 + 7 = 9 piles in total. So we return 10 since
# it's larger. 
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 1 <= piles.length <= 100
# 1 <= piles[i] <= 10 ^ 4
#
