#
# Given alphanumeric string s. (Alphanumeric string is a string consisting of
# lowercase English letters and digits).
# 
# You have to find a permutation ofÂ the string where no letter is followed by
# another letter and no digit is followed by another digit. That is, no two
# adjacent characters have the same type.
# 
# Return the reformatted string or return an empty string if it is impossible
# to reformat the string.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: s = "a0b1c2"
# Output: "0a1b2c"
# Explanation: No two adjacent characters have the same type in "0a1b2c".
# "a0b1c2", "0a1b2c", "0c2a1b" are also valid permutations.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: s = "leetcode"
# Output: ""
# Explanation: "leetcode" has only characters so we cannot separate them by
# digits.
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: s = "1229857369"
# Output: ""
# Explanation: "1229857369" has only digits so we cannot separate them by
# characters.
# 
# 
# Example 4:
# 
# 
# Input: s = "covid2019"
# Output: "c2o0v1i9d"
# 
# 
# Example 5:
# 
# 
# Input: s = "ab123"
# Output: "1a2b3"
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 1 <= s.length <= 500
# s consists of only lowercase English letters and/or digits.
#

class Solution:
    def reformat(self, s: str) -> str:
        s = list(s)
        s1, s2 = [], []
        for ch in s:
            if ch.isalpha():
                s1.append(ch)
            elif ch.isnumeric():
                s2.append(ch)

        m, n = map(len, (s1, s2))
        if m < n:
            m, n = n, m
            s1, s2 = s2, s1

        if not (m == n or m - 1 == n):
            return ""

        res = [""] * (m + n)
        res[::2] = s1
        res[1::2] = s2

        return "".join(res)
