# Testcase Example:  '["mobile","mouse","moneypot","monitor","mousepad"]\r\n"mouse"\r'
#
# Given an array of strings products and a string searchWord. We want to design
# a system that suggests at most three product names from products after each
# character of searchWord is typed. Suggested products should have common
# prefix with the searchWord. If there are more than three products with a
# common prefix return the three lexicographically minimums products.
# 
# Return list of lists of the suggested products after each character of
# searchWord is typed. 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: products = ["mobile","mouse","moneypot","monitor","mousepad"],
# searchWord = "mouse"
# Output: [
# ["mobile","moneypot","monitor"],
# ["mobile","moneypot","monitor"],
# ["mouse","mousepad"],
# ["mouse","mousepad"],
# ["mouse","mousepad"]
# ]
# Explanation: products sorted lexicographically =
# ["mobile","moneypot","monitor","mouse","mousepad"]
# After typing m and mo all products match and we show user
# ["mobile","moneypot","monitor"]
# After typing mou, mous and mouse the system suggests ["mouse","mousepad"]
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: products = ["havana"], searchWord = "havana"
# Output: [["havana"],["havana"],["havana"],["havana"],["havana"],["havana"]]
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: products = ["bags","baggage","banner","box","cloths"], searchWord =
# "bags"
# Output:
# [["baggage","bags","banner"],["baggage","bags","banner"],["baggage","bags"],["bags"]]
# 
# 
# Example 4:
# 
# 
# Input: products = ["havana"], searchWord = "tatiana"
# Output: [[],[],[],[],[],[],[]]
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 1 <= products.length <= 1000
# There are no repeated elements in products.
# 1 <= Σ products[i].length <= 2 * 10^4
# All characters of products[i] are lower-case English letters.
# 1 <= searchWord.length <= 1000
# All characters of searchWord are lower-case English letters.
#
