#
# You want to form a target string of lowercase letters.
# 
# At the beginning, your sequence is target.length '?' marks.  You also have a
# stamp of lowercase letters.
# 
# On each turn, you may place the stamp over the sequence, and replace every
# letter in the sequence with the corresponding letter from the stamp.  You can
# make up to 10 * target.length turns.
# 
# For example, if the initial sequence is "?????", and your stamp is "abc",
# then you may make "abc??", "?abc?", "??abc" in the first turn.  (Note that
# the stamp must be fully contained in the boundaries of the sequence in order
# to stamp.)
# 
# If the sequence is possible to stamp, then return an array of the index of
# the left-most letter being stamped at each turn.  If the sequence is not
# possible to stamp, return an empty array.
# 
# For example, if the sequence is "ababc", and the stamp is "abc", then we
# could return the answer [0, 2], corresponding to the moves "?????" -> "abc??"
# -> "ababc".
# 
# Also, if the sequence is possible to stamp, it is guaranteed it is possible
# to stamp within 10 * target.length moves.  Any answers specifying more than
# this number of moves will not be accepted.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: stamp = "abc", target = "ababc"
# Output: [0,2]
# ([1,0,2] would also be accepted as an answer, as well as some other
# answers.)
# 
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: stamp = "abca", target = "aabcaca"
# Output: [3,0,1]
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 1 <= stamp.length <= target.length <= 1000
# stamp and target only contain lowercase letters.
