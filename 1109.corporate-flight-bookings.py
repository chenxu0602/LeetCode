# Testcase Example:  '[[1,2,10],[2,3,20],[2,5,25]]\n5'
#
# There are n flights, and they are labeled from 1 to n.
# 
# We have a list of flight bookings.  The i-th booking bookings[i] = [i, j, k]
# means that we booked k seats from flights labeled i to j inclusive.
# 
# Return an array answer of length n, representing the number of seats booked
# on each flight in order of their label.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: bookings = [[1,2,10],[2,3,20],[2,5,25]], n = 5
# Output: [10,55,45,25,25]
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 1 <= bookings.length <= 20000
# 1 <= bookings[i][0] <= bookings[i][1] <= n <= 20000
# 1 <= bookings[i][2] <= 10000
#

    def corpFlightBookings(self, bookings: List[List[int]], n: int) -> List[int]:
        
        res = [0] * (n+1)
        for i, j, k in bookings:
            res[i-1] += k
            res[j] -= k
        for i in range(1, n):
            res[i] += res[i-1]
        return res[:-1]
