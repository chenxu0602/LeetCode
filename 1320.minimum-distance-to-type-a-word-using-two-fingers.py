#
# 
# 
# You have a keyboard layout as shown above in the XY plane, where each English
# uppercase letter is located at some coordinate, for example, the letter A is
# located at coordinate (0,0), the letter B is located at coordinate (0,1), the
# letter P is located at coordinate (2,3) and the letter Z is located at
# coordinate (4,1).
# 
# Given the string word, return the minimum total distance to type such string
# using only two fingers. The distance between coordinates (x1,y1) and (x2,y2)
# is |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|. 
# 
# Note that the initial positions of your two fingers are considered free so
# don't count towards your total distance, also your two fingers do not have to
# start at the first letter or the first two letters.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: word = "CAKE"
# Output: 3
# Explanation: 
# Using two fingers, one optimal way to type "CAKE" is: 
# Finger 1 on letter 'C' -> cost = 0 
# Finger 1 on letter 'A' -> cost = Distance from letter 'C' to letter 'A' = 2 
# Finger 2 on letter 'K' -> cost = 0 
# Finger 2 on letter 'E' -> cost = Distance from letter 'K' to letter 'E' = 1 
# Total distance = 3
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: word = "HAPPY"
# Output: 6
# Explanation: 
# Using two fingers, one optimal way to type "HAPPY" is:
# Finger 1 on letter 'H' -> cost = 0
# Finger 1 on letter 'A' -> cost = Distance from letter 'H' to letter 'A' = 2
# Finger 2 on letter 'P' -> cost = 0
# Finger 2 on letter 'P' -> cost = Distance from letter 'P' to letter 'P' = 0
# Finger 1 on letter 'Y' -> cost = Distance from letter 'A' to letter 'Y' = 4
# Total distance = 6
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: word = "NEW"
# Output: 3
# 
# 
# Example 4:
# 
# 
# Input: word = "YEAR"
# Output: 7
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 2 <= word.length <= 300
# Each word[i] is an English uppercase letter.

class Solution:
    def minimumDistance(self, word: str) -> int:

        # def dist(a, b):
        #     return a and abs(a//6 - b//6) + abs(a % 6 - b % 6)

        # dp, dp2 = {(0, 0): 0}, {}
        # for c in [ord(c) + 1 for c in word]:
        #     for a, b in dp:
        #         dp2[c, b] = min(dp2.get((c, b), 3000), dp[a, b] + dist(a, c))
        #         dp2[a, c] = min(dp2.get((a, c), 3000), dp[a, b] + dist(b, c))
        #     dp, dp2 = dp2, {}
        # return min(dp.values())

        # Instead of moving right finger from b to c with distance d(b, c),
        # we try moving left finger from a to c with distance d(a, c).
        # Hopely this will save d(b, c) - d(a, c).

        def dist(a, b):
            return abs(a//6 - b//6) + abs(a%6 - b%6)

        A = [ord(c) - ord('A') for c in word]
        dp = [0] * 26
        for b, c in zip(A, A[1:]):
            dp[b] = max(dp[a] + dist(b, c) - dist(a, c) for a in range(26))

        return sum(dist(b, c) for b, c in zip(A, A[1:])) - max(dp)
