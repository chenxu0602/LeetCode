#
# You are given a 2D integer array, queries. For each queries[i], where
# queries[i] = [ni, ki], find the number of different ways you can place
# positive integers into an array of size ni such that the product of the
# integers is ki. As the number of ways may be too large, the answer to the
# i^th query is the number of ways modulo 10^9 + 7.
# 
# Return an integer array answer where answer.length == queries.length, and
# answer[i] is the answer to the i^th query.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: queries = [[2,6],[5,1],[73,660]]
# Output: [4,1,50734910]
# Explanation:Â Each query is independent.
# [2,6]: There are 4 ways to fill an array of size 2 that multiply to 6: [1,6],
# [2,3], [3,2], [6,1].
# [5,1]: There is 1 way to fill an array of size 5 that multiply to 1:
# [1,1,1,1,1].
# [73,660]: There are 1050734917 ways to fill an array of size 73 that multiply
# to 660. 1050734917 modulo 10^9 + 7 = 50734910.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: queries = [[1,1],[2,2],[3,3],[4,4],[5,5]]
# Output: [1,2,3,10,5]
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 1 <= queries.length <= 10^4 
# 1 <= ni, ki <= 10^4
#
