# Testcase Example:  '["with","example","science"]\n"thehat"'
#
# 
# We are given N different types of stickers.  Each sticker has a lowercase
# English word on it.
# 
# You would like to spell out the given target string by cutting individual
# letters from your collection of stickers and rearranging them.
# 
# You can use each sticker more than once if you want, and you have infinite
# quantities of each sticker.
# 
# What is the minimum number of stickers that you need to spell out the
# target?  If the task is impossible, return -1.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# Input:
# ["with", "example", "science"], "thehat"
# 
# 
# Output:
# 3
# 
# 
# Explanation:
# We can use 2 "with" stickers, and 1 "example" sticker.
# After cutting and rearrange the letters of those stickers, we can form the
# target "thehat".
# Also, this is the minimum number of stickers necessary to form the target
# string.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# Input:
# ["notice", "possible"], "basicbasic"
# 
# 
# Output:
# -1
# 
# 
# Explanation:
# We can't form the target "basicbasic" from cutting letters from the given
# stickers.
# 
# 
# Note:
# stickers has length in the range [1, 50].
# stickers consists of lowercase English words (without apostrophes).
# target has length in the range [1, 15], and consists of lowercase English
# letters.
# In all test cases, all words were chosen randomly from the 1000 most common
# US English words, and the target was chosen as a concatenation of two random
# words.
# The time limit may be more challenging than usual.  It is expected that a 50
# sticker test case can be solved within 35ms on average.
