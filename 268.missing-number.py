#
# Given an array containing n distinct numbers taken from 0, 1, 2, ..., n, find
# the one that is missing from the array.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: [3,0,1]
# Output: 2
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
# Output: 8

# Note:
# Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement
# it using only constant extra space complexity?

class Solution:
    def missingNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # Because we know that nums contains nn numbers and that it is missing exactly one number on the range [0..n-1][0..nâˆ’1], we know that nn definitely replaces the missing number in nums. Therefore, if we initialize an integer to nn and XOR it with every index and value, we will be left with the missing number. 
        missing = len(nums)
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            missing ^= i ^ num
        return missing
