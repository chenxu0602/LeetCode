#
# Given an array containing n distinct numbers taken from 0, 1, 2, ..., n, find
# the one that is missing from the array.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: [3,0,1]
# Output: 2

# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
# Output: 8

# Note:
# Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement
# it using only constant extra space complexity?

class Solution:
    def missingNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:

        missing = len(nums)
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            missing ^= i ^ num
        return missing
