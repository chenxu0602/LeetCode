#
# Given a string S and a string T, find the minimum window in S which will
# contain all the characters in T in complexity O(n).
# 
# Example:
# 
# 
# Input: S = "ADOBECODEBANC", T = "ABC"
# Output: "BANC"
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# If there is no such window in S that covers all characters in T, return the
# empty string "".
# If there is such window, you are guaranteed that there will always be only
# one unique minimum window in S.
