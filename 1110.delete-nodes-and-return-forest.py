# Testcase Example:  '[1,2,3,4,5,6,7]\n[3,5]'
#
# Given the root of a binary tree, each node in the tree has a distinct value.
# 
# After deleting all nodes with a value in to_delete, we are left with a forest
# (a disjoint union of trees).
# 
# Return the roots of the trees in the remaining forest.  You may return the
# result in any order.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], to_delete = [3,5]
# Output: [[1,2,null,4],[6],[7]]
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# The number of nodes in the given tree is at most 1000.
# Each node has a distinct value between 1 and 1000.
# to_delete.length <= 1000
# to_delete contains distinct values between 1 and 1000.
# 
#
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    def delNodes(self, root: TreeNode, to_delete: List[int]) -> List[TreeNode]:
        to_delete_set = set(to_delete)
        res = []

        def dfs(root, is_root):
            if not root:
                return None

            root_deleted = root.val in to_delete_set

            if is_root and not root_deleted:
                res.append(root)

            root.left = dfs(root.left, root_deleted)
            root.right = dfs(root.right, root_deleted)

            return None if root_deleted else root

        dfs(root, True)
        return res
