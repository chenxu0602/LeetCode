#
# For a string sequence, a string word is k-repeating if word concatenated k
# times is a substring of sequence. The word's maximum k-repeating value is the
# highest value k where word is k-repeating in sequence. If word is not a
# substring of sequence, word's maximum k-repeating value is 0.
# 
# Given strings sequence and word, return the maximum k-repeating value of word
# in sequence.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: sequence = "ababc", word = "ab"
# Output: 2
# Explanation: "abab" is a substring in "ababc".
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: sequence = "ababc", word = "ba"
# Output: 1
# Explanation: "ba" is a substring in "ababc". "baba" is not a substring in
# "ababc".
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: sequence = "ababc", word = "ac"
# Output: 0
# Explanation: "ac" is not a substring in "ababc". 
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 1 <= sequence.length <= 100
# 1 <= word.length <= 100
# sequence and wordÂ contains only lowercase English letters.

class Solution:
    def maxRepeating(self, sequence: str, word: str) -> int:
        ans = 1
        while word * ans in sequence:
            ans += 1
        return ans - 1
