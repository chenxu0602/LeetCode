#
# Given a non-empty binary tree, return the average value of the nodes on each
# level in the form of an array.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# Input:
# ⁠   3
# ⁠  / \
# ⁠ 9  20
# ⁠   /  \
# ⁠  15   7
# Output: [3, 14.5, 11]
# Explanation:
# The average value of nodes on level 0 is 3,  on level 1 is 14.5, and on level
# 2 is 11. Hence return [3, 14.5, 11].
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# The range of node's value is in the range of 32-bit signed integer.
# 
# 
#
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    def averageOfLevels(self, root: TreeNode) -> List[float]:
        ans = []
        lvl = [root]
        while lvl:
            ans.append(sum(n.val for n in lvl) / float(len(lvl)))
            lvl = [c for n in lvl for c in [n.left, n.right] if c]

        return ans
