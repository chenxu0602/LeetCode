# Testcase Example:  '"(123)"'
#
# We had some 2-dimensional coordinates, like "(1, 3)" or "(2, 0.5)".  Then, we
# removed all commas, decimal points, and spaces, and ended up with the string
# S.  Return a list of strings representing all possibilities for what our
# original coordinates could have been.
# 
# Our original representation never had extraneous zeroes, so we never started
# with numbers like "00", "0.0", "0.00", "1.0", "001", "00.01", or any other
# number that can be represented with less digits.  Also, a decimal point
# within a number never occurs without at least one digit occuring before it,
# so we never started with numbers like ".1".
# 
# The final answer list can be returned in any order.  Also note that all
# coordinates in the final answer have exactly one space between them
# (occurring after the comma.)
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# Input: "(123)"
# Output: ["(1, 23)", "(12, 3)", "(1.2, 3)", "(1, 2.3)"]
# 
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# Input: "(00011)"
# Output:  ["(0.001, 1)", "(0, 0.011)"]
# Explanation: 
# 0.0, 00, 0001 or 00.01 are not allowed.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# Input: "(0123)"
# Output: ["(0, 123)", "(0, 12.3)", "(0, 1.23)", "(0.1, 23)", "(0.1, 2.3)",
# "(0.12, 3)"]
# 
# 
# 
# Example 4:
# Input: "(100)"
# Output: [(10, 0)]
# Explanation: 
# 1.0 is not allowed.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Note: 
# 
# 
# 4 <= S.length <= 12.
# S[0] = "(", S[S.length - 1] = ")", and the other elements in S are
# digits.
