# A chess knight can move as indicated in the chess diagram below:
# 
# .           
# 
# 
# 
# This time, we place our chess knight on any numbered key of a phone pad
# (indicated above), and the knight makes N-1 hops.  Each hop must be from one
# key to another numbered key.
# 
# Each time it lands on a key (including the initial placement of the knight),
# it presses the number of that key, pressing N digits total.
# 
# How many distinct numbers can you dial in this manner?
# 
# Since the answer may be large, output the answer modulo 10^9 + 7.

# 
# Input: 1
# Output: 10

# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: 2
# Output: 20

# Example 3:

# 
# Input: 3
# Output: 46

class Solution:
    def knightDialer(self, N: int) -> int:
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        moves = [[4, 6], [6, 8], [7, 9], [4, 8],
                 [3, 9, 0], [], [1, 7, 0], [2, 6],
                 [1, 3], [2, 4]]

        dp = [1] * 10
        for hops in range(N - 1):
            dp2 = [0] * 10
            for node, count in enumerate(dp):
                for nei in moves[node]:
                    dp2[nei] += count
                    dp2[nei] %= MOD
            dp = dp2
        return sum(dp) % MOD
