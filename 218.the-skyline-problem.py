#
# A city's skyline is the outer contour of the silhouette formed by all the
# buildings in that city when viewed from a distance. Now suppose you are given
# the locations and height of all the buildings as shown on a cityscape photo
# (Figure A), write a program to output the skyline formed by these buildings
# collectively (Figure B).
# ⁠   
# 
# The geometric information of each building is represented by a triplet of
# integers [Li, Ri, Hi], where Li and Ri are the x coordinates of the left and
# right edge of the ith building, respectively, and Hi is its height. It is
# guaranteed that 0 ≤ Li, Ri ≤ INT_MAX, 0 < Hi ≤ INT_MAX, and Ri - Li > 0. You
# may assume all buildings are perfect rectangles grounded on an absolutely
# flat surface at height 0.
# 
# For instance, the dimensions of all buildings in Figure A are recorded as: [
# [2 9 10], [3 7 15], [5 12 12], [15 20 10], [19 24 8] ] .
# 
# The output is a list of "key points" (red dots in Figure B) in the format of
# [ [x1,y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], ... ] that uniquely defines a skyline. A key
# point is the left endpoint of a horizontal line segment. Note that the last
# key point, where the rightmost building ends, is merely used to mark the
# termination of the skyline, and always has zero height. Also, the ground in
# between any two adjacent buildings should be considered part of the skyline
# contour.
# 
# For instance, the skyline in Figure B should be represented as:[ [2 10], [3
# 15], [7 12], [12 0], [15 10], [20 8], [24, 0] ].
# 
# Notes:
# 
# 
# The number of buildings in any input list is guaranteed to be in the range
# [0, 10000].
# The input list is already sorted in ascending order by the left x position
# Li.
# The output list must be sorted by the x position.
# There must be no consecutive horizontal lines of equal height in the output
# skyline. For instance, [...[2 3], [4 5], [7 5], [11 5], [12 7]...] is not
# acceptable; the three lines of height 5 should be merged into one in the
# final output as such: [...[2 3], [4 5], [12 7], ...]
