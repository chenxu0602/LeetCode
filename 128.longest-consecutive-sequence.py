#
# Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest
# consecutive elements sequence.
# 
# Your algorithm should run in O(n) complexity.
# 
# Example:
# 
# 
# Input:Â [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
# Output: 4
# Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4].
# Therefore its length is 4.

        #         current_streak = 1

        #         while current_num + 1 in num_set:
        #             current_num += 1
        #             current_streak += 1

        #         longest_streak = max(longest_streak, current_streak)
