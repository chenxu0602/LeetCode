#
# Given a matrix, and a target, return the number of non-empty submatrices that
# sum to target.
# 
# A submatrix x1, y1, x2, y2 is the set of all cells matrix[x][y] with x1 <= x
# <= x2 and y1 <= y <= y2.
# 
# Two submatrices (x1, y1, x2, y2) and (x1', y1', x2', y2') are different if
# they have some coordinateÂ that is different: for example, if x1 != x1'.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: matrix = [[0,1,0],[1,1,1],[0,1,0]], target = 0
# Output: 4
# Explanation: The four 1x1 submatrices that only contain 0.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: matrix = [[1,-1],[-1,1]], target = 0
# Output: 5
# Explanation: The two 1x2 submatrices, plus the two 2x1 submatrices, plus the
# 2x2 submatrix.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# 1 <= matrix.length <= 300
# 1 <= matrix[0].length <= 300
# -1000 <= matrix[i] <= 1000
# -10^8 <= target <= 10^8
