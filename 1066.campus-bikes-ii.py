#
# On a campus represented as a 2D grid, there are N workers and M bikes, with N
# <= M. Each worker and bike is a 2D coordinate on this grid.
# 
# We assign one unique bike to each worker so that the sum of the Manhattan
# distances between each worker and their assigned bike is minimized.
# 
# The Manhattan distance between two points p1 and p2 is Manhattan(p1, p2) =
# |p1.x - p2.x| + |p1.y - p2.y|.
# 
# Return the minimum possible sum of Manhattan distances between each worker
# and their assigned bike.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: workers = [[0,0],[2,1]], bikes = [[1,2],[3,3]]
# Output: 6
# Explanation: 
# We assign bike 0 to worker 0, bike 1 to worker 1. The Manhattan distance of
# both assignments is 3, so the output is 6.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: workers = [[0,0],[1,1],[2,0]], bikes = [[1,0],[2,2],[2,1]]
# Output: 4
# Explanation: 
# We first assign bike 0 to worker 0, then assign bike 1 to worker 1 or worker
# 2, bike 2 to worker 2 or worker 1. Both assignments lead to sum of the
# Manhattan distances as 4.
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: workers = [[0,0],[1,0],[2,0],[3,0],[4,0]], bikes =
# [[0,999],[1,999],[2,999],[3,999],[4,999]]
# Output: 4995
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# N == workers.length
# M == bikes.length
# 1 <= N <= M <= 10
# workers[i].length == 2
# bikes[i].length == 2
# 0 <= workers[i][0], workers[i][1], bikes[i][0], bikes[i][1] < 1000
# All the workers and the bikes locations are unique.
