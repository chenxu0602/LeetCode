#
# Given a (singly) linked list with head node root, write a function to split
# the linked list into k consecutive linked list "parts".
# 
# The length of each part should be as equal as possible: no two parts should
# have a size differing by more than 1.  This may lead to some parts being
# null.
# 
# The parts should be in order of occurrence in the input list, and parts
# occurring earlier should always have a size greater than or equal parts
# occurring later.
# 
# Return a List of ListNode's representing the linked list parts that are
# formed.
# 
# 
# Examples
# 1->2->3->4, k = 5 // 5 equal parts
# [ [1], 
# [2],
# [3],
# [4],
# null ]
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# Input: 
# root = [1, 2, 3], k = 5
# Output: [[1],[2],[3],[],[]]
# Explanation:
# The input and each element of the output are ListNodes, not arrays.
# For example, the input root has root.val = 1, root.next.val = 2,
# \root.next.next.val = 3, and root.next.next.next = null.
# The first element output[0] has output[0].val = 1, output[0].next = null.
# The last element output[4] is null, but it's string representation as a
# ListNode is [].
# 
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# Input: 
# root = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], k = 3
# Output: [[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7], [8, 9, 10]]
# Explanation:
# The input has been split into consecutive parts with size difference at most
# 1, and earlier parts are a larger size than the later parts.
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# The length of root will be in the range [0, 1000].
# Each value of a node in the input will be an integer in the range [0, 999].
# k will be an integer in the range [1, 50].
# 
#
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None
