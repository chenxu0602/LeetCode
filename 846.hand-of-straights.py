#
# Alice has a hand of cards, given as an array of integers.
# 
# Now she wants to rearrange the cards into groups so that each group is size
# W, and consists of W consecutive cards.
# 
# Return true if and only if she can.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: hand = [1,2,3,6,2,3,4,7,8], W = 3
# Output: true
# Explanation: Alice's hand can be rearranged as [1,2,3],[2,3,4],[6,7,8].
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: hand = [1,2,3,4,5], W = 4
# Output: false
# Explanation: Alice's hand can't be rearranged into groups of 4.
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# 1 <= hand.length <= 10000
# 0 <= hand[i]Â <= 10^9
# 1 <= W <= hand.length
# 
#
