# Testcase Example:  '[-2,5,-1]\n-2\n2'
#
# Given an integer array nums, return the number of range sums that lie in
# [lower, upper] inclusive.
# Range sum S(i, j) is defined as the sum of the elements in nums between
# indices i and j (i â‰¤ j), inclusive.
# 
# Note:
# A naive algorithm of O(n^2) is trivial. You MUST do better than that.
# 
# Example:
# 
# 
# Input: nums = [-2,5,-1], lower = -2, upper = 2,
# Output: 3 
# Explanation: The three ranges are : [0,0], [2,2], [0,2] and their respective
# sums are: -2, -1, 2.

class Solution:
    def countRangeSum(self, nums: List[int], lower: int, upper: int) -> int:
        first = [0]
        for num in nums:
            first.append(first[-1] + num)

        def sort(lo, hi):
            mid = (lo + hi) // 2
            if mid == lo:
                return 0

            count = sort(lo, mid) + sort(mid, hi)

            i = j = mid
            for left in first[lo:mid]:
                while i < hi and first[i] - left < lower: 
                    i += 1
                while j < hi and first[j] - left <= upper: 
                    j += 1
                count += j - i

            first[lo:hi] = sorted(first[lo:hi])
            return count

        return sort(0, len(first))
