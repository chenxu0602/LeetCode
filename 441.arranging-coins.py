# Testcase Example:  '5'
#
# You have a total of n coins that you want to form in a staircase shape, where
# every k-th row must have exactly k coins.
# ⁠
# Given n, find the total number of full staircase rows that can be formed.
# 
# n is a non-negative integer and fits within the range of a 32-bit signed
# integer.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# n = 5
# 
# The coins can form the following rows:
# ¤
# ¤ ¤
# ¤ ¤
# 
# Because the 3rd row is incomplete, we return 2.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# n = 8
# 
# The coins can form the following rows:
# ¤
# ¤ ¤
# ¤ ¤ ¤
# ¤ ¤
# 
# Because the 4th row is incomplete, we return 3.
# 
#

class Solution:
    def arrangeCoins(self, n: int) -> int:

        # O(logN) / O(1)
        left, right = 0, n
        while left <= right:
            k = (left + right) // 2
            curr = k * (k + 1) // 2
            if curr == n:
                return k
            if n < curr:
                right = k - 1
            else:
                left = k + 1

        return right
