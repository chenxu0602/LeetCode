# Testcase Example:  '"bbbab"'
#
# 
# Given a string s, find the longest palindromic subsequence's length in s. You
# may assume that the maximum length of s is 1000.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# Input: 
# 
# "bbbab"
# 
# Output: 
# 
# 4
# 
# One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bbbb".
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# Input:
# 
# "cbbd"
# 
# Output:
# 
# 2
# 
# One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bb".
#

class Solution:
    def longestPalindromeSubseq(self, s: str) -> int:
        if s == s[::-1]:
            return len(s)

        n = len(s)
        dp = [[0 for j in range(n)] for i in range(n)]

        for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
            dp[i][i] = 1
            for j in range(i+1, n):
                if s[i] == s[j]:
                    dp[i][j] = 2 + dp[i+1][j-1]
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j-1])

        return dp[0][n-1]
