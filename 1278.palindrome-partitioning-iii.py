# Testcase Example:  '"abc"\n2'
#
# You are given a string s containing lowercase letters and an integer k. You
# need to :
# 
# 
# First, change some characters of s to other lowercase English letters.
# Then divide s into k non-empty disjoint substrings such that each substring
# is palindrome.
# 
# 
# Return the minimal number of characters that you need to change to divide the
# string.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: s = "abc", k = 2
# Output: 1
# Explanation: You can split the string into "ab" and "c", and change 1
# character in "ab" to make it palindrome.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: s = "aabbc", k = 3
# Output: 0
# Explanation: You can split the string into "aa", "bb" and "c", all of them
# are palindrome.
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: s = "leetcode", k = 8
# Output: 0
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 1 <= k <= s.length <= 100.
# s only contains lowercase English letters.
