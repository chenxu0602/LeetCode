#
# Given an integer array with all positive numbers and no duplicates, find the
# number of possible combinations that add up to a positive integer target.
# 
# Example:
# 
# 
# nums = [1, 2, 3]
# target = 4
# 
# The possible combination ways are:
# (1, 1, 1, 1)
# (1, 1, 2)
# (1, 2, 1)
# (1, 3)
# (2, 1, 1)
# (2, 2)
# (3, 1)
# 
# Note that different sequences are counted as different combinations.
# 
# Therefore the output is 7.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Follow up:
# What if negative numbers are allowed in the given array?
# How does it change the problem?
# What limitation we need to add to the question to allow negative numbers?
# 
# Credits:
# Special thanks to @pbrother for adding this problem and creating all test
# cases.

class Solution:
    def combinationSum4(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:

        dp = [1] + [0] * target
        for x in range(1, target + 1):
            for y in nums:
                if x >= y:
                    dp[x] += dp[x-y]
        return dp[target]
