#
# You are given an array points, an integer angle, and your location, where
# location = [posx, posy] and points[i] = [xi, yi] both denote integral
# coordinates on the X-Y plane.
# 
# Initially, you are facing directly east from your position. You cannot move
# from your position, but you can rotate. In other words, posx and posy cannot
# be changed. Your field of view in degrees is represented by angle,
# determiningÂ how wide you can see from any given view direction. Let d be the
# amount in degrees that you rotate counterclockwise. Then, your field of view
# is the inclusive range of angles [d - angle/2, d + angle/2].

# 
# 
# You can see some set of points if, for each point, the angle formed by the
# point, your position, and the immediate east direction from your position is
# in your field of view.
# 
# There can be multiple points at one coordinate. There may be points at your
# location, and you can always see these points regardless of your rotation.
# Points do not obstruct your vision to other points.
# 
# Return the maximum number of points you can see.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: points = [[2,1],[2,2],[3,3]], angle = 90, location = [1,1]
# Output: 3
# Explanation: The shaded region represents your field of view. All points can
# be made visible in your field of view, including [3,3] even though [2,2] is
# in front and in the same line of sight.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: points = [[2,1],[2,2],[3,4],[1,1]], angle = 90, location = [1,1]
# Output: 4
# Explanation: All points can be made visible in your field of view, including
# the one at your location.
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: points = [[1,0],[2,1]], angle = 13, location = [1,1]
# Output: 1
# Explanation: You can only see one of the two points, as shown above.
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 1 <= points.length <= 10^5
# points[i].length == 2
# location.length == 2
# 0 <= angle < 360
# 0 <= posx, posy, xi, yi <= 10^9
#
