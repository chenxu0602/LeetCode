# Testcase Example:  '3\n3\n1'
#
# Your music player contains N different songs and she wants to listen to L
# (not necessarily different) songs during your trip.  You create a playlist so
# that:
# 
# 
# Every song is played at least once
# A song can only be played again only if K other songs have been played
# 
# 
# Return the number of possible playlists.  As the answer can be very large,
# return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: N = 3, L = 3, K = 1
# Output: 6
# Explanation: There are 6 possible playlists. [1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2], [2, 1, 3],
# [2, 3, 1], [3, 1, 2], [3, 2, 1].
# 
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: N = 2, L = 3, K = 0
# Output: 6
# Explanation: There are 6 possible playlists. [1, 1, 2], [1, 2, 1], [2, 1, 1],
# [2, 2, 1], [2, 1, 2], [1, 2, 2]
# 
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: N = 2, L = 3, K = 1
# Output: 2
# Explanation: There are 2 possible playlists. [1, 2, 1], [2, 1, 2]
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# 0 <= K < N <= L <= 100
