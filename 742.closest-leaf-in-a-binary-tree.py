#
# Given a binary tree where every node has a unique value, and a target key k,
# find the value of the nearest leaf node to target k in the tree.
# 
# Here, nearest to a leaf means the least number of edges travelled on the
# binary tree to reach any leaf of the tree.  Also, a node is called a leaf if
# it has no children.
# 
# In the following examples, the input tree is represented in flattened form
# row by row.
# The actual root tree given will be a TreeNode object.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# Input:
# root = [1, 3, 2], k = 1
# Diagram of binary tree:
# ⁠         1
# ⁠        / \
# ⁠       3   2
# 
# Output: 2 (or 3)
# 
# Explanation: Either 2 or 3 is the nearest leaf node to the target of 1.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# Input:
# root = [1], k = 1
# Output: 1
# 
# Explanation: The nearest leaf node is the root node itself.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# Input:
# root = [1,2,3,4,null,null,null,5,null,6], k = 2
# Diagram of binary tree:
# ⁠            1
# ⁠           / \
# ⁠          2   3
# ⁠         /
# ⁠        4
# ⁠       /
# ⁠      5
# ⁠     /
# ⁠    6
# 
# Output: 3
# Explanation: The leaf node with value 3 (and not the leaf node with value 6)
# is nearest to the node with value 2.
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# root represents a binary tree with at least 1 node and at most 1000 nodes.
# Every node has a unique node.val in range [1, 1000].
# There exists some node in the given binary tree for which node.val == k.
# 
# 
#
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None
