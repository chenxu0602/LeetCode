#
# A Range Module is a module that tracks ranges of numbers. Your task is to
# design and implement the following interfaces in an efficient manner.
# 
# addRange(int left, int right) Adds the half-open interval [left, right),
# tracking every real number in that interval.  Adding an interval that
# partially overlaps with currently tracked numbers should add any numbers in
# the interval [left, right) that are not already tracked.
# 
# queryRange(int left, int right) Returns true if and only if every real number
# in the interval [left, right)
# ‚Å†is currently being tracked.
# 
# removeRange(int left, int right) Stops tracking every real number currently
# being tracked in the interval [left, right).
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# addRange(10, 20): null
# removeRange(14, 16): null
# queryRange(10, 14): true (Every number in [10, 14) is being tracked)
# queryRange(13, 15): false (Numbers like 14, 14.03, 14.17 in [13, 15) are not
# being tracked)
# queryRange(16, 17): true (The number 16 in [16, 17) is still being tracked,
# despite the remove operation)
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# A half open interval [left, right) denotes all real numbers left .
# 
# 0 < left < right < 10^9 in all calls to addRange, queryRange, removeRange.
# The total number of calls to addRange in a single test case is at most 1000.
# The total number of calls to queryRange in a single test case is at most
# 5000.
# The total number of calls to removeRange in a single test case is at most
# 1000.

    def addRange(self, left: int, right: int) -> None:
#        The assumption is that the elements in self._X means [in, out, in, out, ...]
#        For example, if the elements in self._X is [1,2,3,4], then it represents the intervals [1, 2) \union [3, 4).
#        Thus by computing i % 2 we will know whether the new element falls in an existing interval or not.
#        (for example, if i % 2 == 0, then it falls out of an existing interval)
