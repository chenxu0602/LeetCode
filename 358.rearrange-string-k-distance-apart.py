# Testcase Example:  '"aabbcc"\n3'
#
# Given a non-empty string s and an integer k, rearrange the string such that
# the same characters are at least distance k from each other.
# 
# All input strings are given in lowercase letters. If it is not possible to
# rearrange the string, return an empty string "".
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# 
# Input: s = "aabbcc", k = 3
# Output: "abcabc" 
# Explanation: The same letters are at least distance 3 from each other.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: s = "aaabc", k = 3
# Output: "" 
# Explanation: It is not possible to rearrange the string.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: s = "aaadbbcc", k = 2
# Output: "abacabcd"
# Explanation: The same letters are at least distance 2 from each other.
