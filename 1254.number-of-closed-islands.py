#
# Given a 2D grid consists of 0s (land) and 1s (water).  An island is a maximal
# 4-directionally connected group of 0s and a closed island is an island
# totally (all left, top, right, bottom) surrounded by 1s.
# 
# Return the number of closed islands.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Input: grid =
# [[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0],[1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0],[1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0],[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0]]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: 
# Islands in gray are closed because they are completely surrounded by water
# (group of 1s).
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Input: grid = [[0,0,1,0,0],[0,1,0,1,0],[0,1,1,1,0]]
# Output: 1
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: grid = [[1,1,1,1,1,1,1],
# [1,0,0,0,0,0,1],
# [1,0,1,1,1,0,1],
# [1,0,1,0,1,0,1],
# [1,0,1,1,1,0,1],
# [1,0,0,0,0,0,1],
# ⁠              [1,1,1,1,1,1,1]]
# Output: 2
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 1 <= grid.length, grid[0].length <= 100
# 0 <= grid[i][j] <=1
#
