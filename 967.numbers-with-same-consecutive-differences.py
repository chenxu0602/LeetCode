# Testcase Example:  '3\n7'
#
# Return all non-negative integers of length N such that the absolute
# difference between every two consecutive digits is K.
# 
# Note that every number in the answer must not have leading zeros except for
# the number 0 itself. For example, 01 has one leading zero and is invalid, but
# 0 is valid.
# 
# You may return the answer in any order.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: N = 3, K = 7
# Output: [181,292,707,818,929]
# Explanation: Note that 070 is not a valid number, because it has leading
# zeroes.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: N = 2, K = 1
# Output: [10,12,21,23,32,34,43,45,54,56,65,67,76,78,87,89,98]
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# 1 <= N <= 9
# 0 <= K <= 9
