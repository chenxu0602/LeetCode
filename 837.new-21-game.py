#
# Alice plays the following game, loosely based on the card game "21".
# 
# Alice starts with 0 points, and draws numbers while she has less than K
# points.  During each draw, she gains an integer number of points randomly
# from the range [1, W], where W is an integer.  Each draw is independent and
# the outcomes have equal probabilities.
# 
# Alice stops drawing numbers when she gets K or more points.  What is the
# probability that she has N or less points?
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: N = 10, K = 1, W = 10
# Output: 1.00000
# Explanation:  Alice gets a single card, then stops.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: N = 6, K = 1, W = 10
# Output: 0.60000
# Explanation:  Alice gets a single card, then stops.
# In 6 out of W = 10 possibilities, she is at or below N = 6 points.
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: N = 21, K = 17, W = 10
# Output: 0.73278
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# 0 <= K <= N <= 10000
# 1 <= W <= 10000
# Answers will be accepted as correct if they are within 10^-5 of the correct
# answer.
# The judging time limit has been reduced for this question.

class Solution:
    def new21Game(self, N: int, K: int, W: int) -> float:
        # O(N + W)
        dp = [0.0] * (N + W + 1)
        # dp[x] = the answer when Alice has x points
        for k in range(K, N + 1):
            dp[k] = 1.0

        S = min(N + 1 - K, W)

        # S = dp[k+1] + dp[k+2] + ... + dp[k+W]
        for k in range(K - 1, -1, -1):
            dp[k] = S / float(W)
            S += dp[k] - dp[k + W]

        return dp[0]
