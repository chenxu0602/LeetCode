# Testcase Example:  '[[1,3,1],[1,5,1],[4,2,1]]'
#
# Given a m x n grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top
# left to bottom right which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path.
# 
# Note: You can only move either down or right at any point in time.
# 
# Example:
# 
# 
# Input:
# [
# [1,3,1],
# ⁠ [1,5,1],
# ⁠ [4,2,1]
# ]
# Output: 7
# Explanation: Because the path 1→3→1→1→1 minimizes the sum.

    def minPathSum(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        for i in range(1, m):
            grid[i][0] += grid[i-1][0]
        for i in range(1, n):
            grid[0][i] += grid[0][i-1]
        for i in range(1, m):
            for j in range(1, n):
                grid[i][j] += min(grid[i-1][j], grid[i][j-1])
        return grid[-1][-1]
