# Testcase Example:  '[8,3,10,1,6,null,14,null,null,4,7,13]'
#
# Given the root of a binary tree, find the maximum value V for which there
# exists different nodes A and B where V = |A.val - B.val| and A is an ancestor
# of B.
# 
# (A node A is an ancestor of B if either: any child of A is equal to B, or any
# child of A is an ancestor of B.)
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Input: [8,3,10,1,6,null,14,null,null,4,7,13]
# Output: 7
# Explanation: 
# We have various ancestor-node differences, some of which are given below :
# |8 - 3| = 5
# |3 - 7| = 4
# |8 - 1| = 7
# |10 - 13| = 3
# Among all possible differences, the maximum value of 7 is obtained by |8 - 1|
# = 7.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# The number of nodes in the tree is between 2 and 5000.
# Each node will have value between 0 and 100000.
# 
# 
#
# Definition for a binary tree node.

#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None
