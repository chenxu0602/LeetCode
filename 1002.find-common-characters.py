# Testcase Example:  '["bella","label","roller"]'
#
# Given an array A of strings made only from lowercase letters, return a list
# of all characters that show up in all strings within the list (including
# duplicates).  For example, if a character occurs 3 times in all strings but
# not 4 times, you need to include that character three times in the final
# answer.
# 
# You may return the answer in any order.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: ["bella","label","roller"]
# Output: ["e","l","l"]
# 
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: ["cool","lock","cook"]
# Output: ["c","o"]
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# 1 <= A.length <= 100
# 1 <= A[i].length <= 100
# A[i][j] is a lowercase letter
# 
#
