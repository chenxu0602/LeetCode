#
# Given a directed acyclic graph of N nodes. Find all possible paths from node
# 0 to node N-1, and return them in any order.
# 
# The graph is given as follows:  the nodes are 0, 1, ..., graph.length - 1.
# graph[i] is a list of all nodes j for which the edge (i, j) exists.
# 
# 
# Example:
# Input: [[1,2],[3],[3],[]]
# Output: [[0,1,3],[0,2,3]]
# Explanation: The graph looks like this:
# 0--->1
# |    |
# v    v
# 2--->3
# There are two paths: 0 -> 1 -> 3 and 0 -> 2 -> 3.
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# The number of nodes in the graph will be in the range [2, 15].
# You can print different paths in any order, but you should keep the order of
# nodes inside one path.
#
