# Testcase Example:  '"ababa"'
#
# Given a string text, we are allowed to swap two of the characters in the
# string. Find the length of the longest substring with repeated characters.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: text = "ababa"
# Output: 3
# Explanation: We can swap the first 'b' with the last 'a', or the last 'b'
# with the first 'a'. Then, the longest repeated character substring is "aaa",
# which its length is 3.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: text = "aaabaaa"
# Output: 6
# Explanation: Swap 'b' with the last 'a' (or the first 'a'), and we get
# longest repeated character substring "aaaaaa", which its length is 6.
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: text = "aaabbaaa"
# Output: 4
# 
# 
# Example 4:
# 
# 
# Input: text = "aaaaa"
# Output: 5
# Explanation: No need to swap, longest repeated character substring is
# "aaaaa", length is 5.
# 
# 
# Example 5:
# 
# 
# Input: text = "abcdef"
# Output: 1
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 1 <= text.length <= 20000
# text consist of lowercase English characters only.
