# Testcase Example:  '[[2]]'
#
# On a N * N grid, we place some 1 * 1 * 1 cubes that are axis-aligned with the
# x, y, and z axes.
# 
# Each value v = grid[i][j] represents a tower of v cubes placed on top of grid
# cell (i, j).
# 
# Now we view the projection of these cubes onto the xy, yz, and zx planes.
# 
# A projection is like a shadow, that maps our 3 dimensional figure to a 2
# dimensional plane. 
# 
# Here, we are viewing the "shadow" when looking at the cubes from the top, the
# front, and the side.
# 
# Return the total area of all three
# projections.

# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: [[2]]
# Output: 5
# 
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: [[1,2],[3,4]]
# Output: 17
# Explanation: 
# Here are the three projections ("shadows") of the shape made with each
# axis-aligned plane.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: [[1,0],[0,2]]
# Output: 8
# 
# 
# 
# Example 4:
# 
# 
# Input: [[1,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,1]]
# Output: 14
# 
# 
# 
# Example 5:
# 
# 
# Input: [[2,2,2],[2,1,2],[2,2,2]]
# Output: 21

# Note:

# 
# 1 <= grid.length = grid[0].length <= 50
# 0 <= grid[i][j] <= 50
