# Testcase Example:  '[1,1,2,3,3,4,4,8,8]'
#
# Given a sorted array consisting of only integers where every element appears
# exactly twice except for one element which appears exactlyÂ once. Find this
# single element that appears only once.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: [1,1,2,3,3,4,4,8,8]
# Output: 2
#

# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: [3,3,7,7,10,11,11]
# Output: 10
