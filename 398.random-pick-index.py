# Testcase Example:  '["Solution","pick"]\n[[[1,2,3,3,3]],[3]]'
#
# Given an array of integers with possible duplicates, randomly output the
# index of a given target number. You can assume that the given target number
# must exist in the array.
# 
# Note:
# The array size can be very large. Solution that uses too much extra space
# will not pass the judge.
# 
# Example:
# 
# 
# int[] nums = new int[] {1,2,3,3,3};
# Solution solution = new Solution(nums);
# 
# // pick(3) should return either index 2, 3, or 4 randomly. Each index should
# have equal probability of returning.
# solution.pick(3);
# 
# // pick(1) should return 0. Since in the array only nums[0] is equal to 1.
# solution.pick(1);
# 
#
