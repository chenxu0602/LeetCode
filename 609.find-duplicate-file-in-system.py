#
# Given a list of directory info including directory path, and all the files
# with contents in this directory, you need to find out all the groups of
# duplicate files in the file system in terms of their paths.
# 
# A group of duplicate files consists of at least two files that have exactly
# the same content.
# 
# A single directory info string in the input list has the following format:
# 
# "root/d1/d2/.../dm f1.txt(f1_content) f2.txt(f2_content) ...
# fn.txt(fn_content)"
# 
# It means there are n files (f1.txt, f2.txt ... fn.txt with content
# f1_content, f2_content ... fn_content, respectively) in directory
# root/d1/d2/.../dm. Note that n >= 1 and m >= 0. If m = 0, it means the
# directory is just the root directory.
# 
# The output is a list of group of duplicate file paths. For each group, it
# contains all the file paths of the files that have the same content. A file
# path is a string that has the following format:
# 
# "directory_path/file_name.txt"
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input:
# ["root/a 1.txt(abcd) 2.txt(efgh)", "root/c 3.txt(abcd)", "root/c/d
# 4.txt(efgh)", "root 4.txt(efgh)"]
# Output:  
# 
# [["root/a/2.txt","root/c/d/4.txt","root/4.txt"],["root/a/1.txt","root/c/3.txt"]]
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# No order is required for the final output.
# You may assume the directory name, file name and file content only has
# letters and digits, and the length of file content is in the range of
# [1,50].
# The number of files given is in the range of [1,20000].
# You may assume no files or directories share the same name in the same
# directory.
# You may assume each given directory info represents a unique directory.
# Directory path and file info are separated by a single blank space.
# 
# 
# 
# Follow-up beyond contest:
# 
# 
# Imagine you are given a real file system, how will you search files? DFS or
# BFS?
# If the file content is very large (GB level), how will you modify your
# solution?
# If you can only read the file by 1kb each time, how will you modify your
# solution?
# What is the time complexity of your modified solution? What is the most
# time-consuming part and memory consuming part of it? How to optimize?
# How to make sure the duplicated files you find are not false positive?
#
