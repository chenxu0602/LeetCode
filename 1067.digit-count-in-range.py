# Given an integer d between 0 and 9, and two positive integers low and high as
# lower and upper bounds, respectively. Return the number of times that d
# occurs as a digit in all integers between low and high, including the bounds
# low and high.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: d = 1, low = 1, high = 13
# Output: 6
# Explanation: 
# The digit d=1 occurs 6 times in 1,10,11,12,13. Note that the digit d=1 occurs
# twice in the number 11.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: d = 3, low = 100, high = 250
# Output: 35
# Explanation: 
# The digit d=3 occurs 35 times in 103,113,123,130,131,...,238,239,243.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# 0 <= d <= 9
# 1 <= low <= high <= 2Ã—10^8
#

class Solution:
    def digitsCount(self, d: int, low: int, high: int) -> int:

        def count(N):
            if N == 0:
                return 0

            if d == 0 and N <= 10:
                return 0

            res = 0
            if N % 10 > d:
                res += 1

            if N // 10 > 0:
                res += str(N//10).count(str(d)) * (N % 10)

            res += N // 10 if d else N // 10 - 1

            res += count(N//10) * 10
            return res

        return count(high+1) - count(low)
