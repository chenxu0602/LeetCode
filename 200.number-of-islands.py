#
# Given a 2d grid map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), count the number of
# islands. An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting
# adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of
# the grid are all surrounded by water.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input:
# 11110
# 11010
# 11000
# 00000
# 
# Output:Â 1
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input:
# 11000
# 11000
# 00100
# 00011
# 
# Output: 3

    def numIslands(self, grid: List[List[str]]) -> int:

        def sink(i, j):
            if 0 <= i < len(grid) and 0 <= j < len(grid[i]) and grid[i][j] == '1':
                grid[i][j] = '0'
                list(map(sink, (i+1, i-1, i, i), (j, j, j+1, j-1)))
                return 1
            return 0
        
        return sum(sink(i, j) for i in range(len(grid)) for j in range(len(grid[i])))
