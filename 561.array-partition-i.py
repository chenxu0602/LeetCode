#
# 
# Given an array of 2n integers, your task is to group these integers into n
# pairs of integer, say (a1, b1), (a2, b2), ..., (an, bn) which makes sum of
# min(ai, bi) for all i from 1 to n as large as possible.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# Input: [1,4,3,2]
# 
# Output: 4
# Explanation: n is 2, and the maximum sum of pairs is 4 = min(1, 2) + min(3,
# 4).
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# n is a positive integer, which is in the range of [1, 10000].
# All the integers in the array will be in the range of [-10000, 10000].
# 
#

class Solution:
    def arrayPairSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # O(nlogn) / O(1)
        # nums.sort()
        # s = 0
        # for i in range(0, len(nums), 2):
        #     s += nums[i]

        # return s


        # O(n) / O(n)
        # arr[i] stores the frequency of occurence of (i-10000)^{th}(iâˆ’10000)th element.
        lim = 10000
        arr = [0] * (2 * lim + 1)

        for num in nums:
            arr[num + lim] += 1

        d, sums = 0, 0
        for i in range(-lim, lim):
            sums += (arr[i + lim] + 1 - d) // 2 * i
            d = (2 + arr[i + lim] - d) % 2

        return sums
