#
# 
# Given a list of sorted characters letters containing only lowercase letters,
# and given a target letter target, find the smallest element in the list that
# is larger than the given target.
# 
# Letters also wrap around.  For example, if the target is target = 'z' and
# letters = ['a', 'b'], the answer is 'a'.
# 
# 
# Examples:
# 
# Input:
# letters = ["c", "f", "j"]
# target = "a"
# Output: "c"
# 
# Input:
# letters = ["c", "f", "j"]
# target = "c"
# Output: "f"
# 
# Input:
# letters = ["c", "f", "j"]
# target = "d"
# Output: "f"
# 
# Input:
# letters = ["c", "f", "j"]
# target = "g"
# Output: "j"
# 
# Input:
# letters = ["c", "f", "j"]
# target = "j"
# Output: "c"
# 
# Input:
# letters = ["c", "f", "j"]
# target = "k"
# Output: "c"
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# letters has a length in range [2, 10000].
# letters consists of lowercase letters, and contains at least 2 unique
# letters.
# target is a lowercase letter.

    def nextGreatestLetter(self, letters: List[str], target: str) -> str:
        index = bisect.bisect_right(letters, target)
        return letters[index % len(letters)]
