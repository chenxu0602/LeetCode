#
# There are N workers.  The i-th worker has a quality[i] and a minimum wage
# expectation wage[i].
# 
# Now we want to hire exactly K workers to form a paid group.  When hiring a
# group of K workers, we must pay them according to the following rules:
# 
# 
# Every worker in the paid group should be paid in the ratio of their quality
# compared to other workers in the paid group.
# Every worker in the paid group must be paid at least their minimum wage
# expectation.
# 
# 
# Return the least amount of money needed to form a paid group satisfying the
# above conditions.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: quality = [10,20,5], wage = [70,50,30], K = 2
# Output: 105.00000
# Explanation: We pay 70 to 0-th worker and 35 to 2-th worker.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: quality = [3,1,10,10,1], wage = [4,8,2,2,7], K = 3
# Output: 30.66667
# Explanation: We pay 4 to 0-th worker, 13.33333 to 2-th and 3-th workers
# seperately. 
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# 1 <= K <= N <= 10000, where N = quality.length = wage.length
# 1 <= quality[i] <= 10000
# 1 <= wage[i] <= 10000
# Answers within 10^-5 of the correct answer will be considered correct.
