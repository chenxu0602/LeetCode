#
# In a list of songs, the i-th song has a duration of time[i] seconds. 
# 
# Return the number of pairs of songs for which their total duration in seconds
# is divisible by 60.  Formally, we want the number of indices i < j with
# (time[i] + time[j]) % 60 == 0.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: [30,20,150,100,40]
# Output: 3
# Explanation: Three pairs have a total duration divisible by 60:
# (time[0] = 30, time[2] = 150): total duration 180
# (time[1] = 20, time[3] = 100): total duration 120
# (time[1] = 20, time[4] = 40): total duration 60
# 
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: [60,60,60]
# Output: 3
# Explanation: All three pairs have a total duration of 120, which is divisible
# by 60.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# 1 <= time.length <= 60000
# 1 <= time[i] <= 500
# 
#
