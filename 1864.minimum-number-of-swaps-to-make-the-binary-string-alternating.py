#
# Given a binary string s, return the minimum number of character swaps to make
# it alternating, or -1 if it is impossible.
# 
# The string is called alternating if no two adjacent characters are equal. For
# example, the strings "010" and "1010" are alternating, while the string
# "0100" is not.
# 
# Any two characters may be swapped, even if they areÂ not adjacent.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: s = "111000"
# Output: 1
# Explanation: Swap positions 1 and 4: "111000" -> "101010"
# The string is now alternating.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: s = "010"
# Output: 0
# Explanation: The string is already alternating, no swaps are needed.
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: s = "1110"
# Output: -1
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 1 <= s.length <= 1000
# s[i] is either '0' or '1'.
