# Testcase Example:  '[1,2,3]'
#
# Given a binary tree containing digits from 0-9 only, each root-to-leaf path
# could represent a number.
# 
# An example is the root-to-leaf path 1->2->3 which represents the number 123.
# 
# Find the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers.
# 
# Note: A leaf is a node with no children.
# 
# Example:
# 
# 
# Input: [1,2,3]
# ⁠   1
# ⁠  / \
# ⁠ 2   3
# Output: 25
# Explanation:
# The root-to-leaf path 1->2 represents the number 12.
# The root-to-leaf path 1->3 represents the number 13.
# Therefore, sum = 12 + 13 = 25.
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: [4,9,0,5,1]
# ⁠   4
# ⁠  / \
# ⁠ 9   0
# / \
# 5   1
# Output: 1026
# Explanation:
# The root-to-leaf path 4->9->5 represents the number 495.
# The root-to-leaf path 4->9->1 represents the number 491.
# The root-to-leaf path 4->0 represents the number 40.
# Therefore, sum = 495 + 491 + 40 = 1026.
