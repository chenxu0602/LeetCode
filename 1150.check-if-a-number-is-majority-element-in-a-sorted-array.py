# Testcase Example:  '[2,4,5,5,5,5,5,6,6]\n5'
#
# Given an array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, and a number target,
# return True if and only if target is a majority element.
# 
# A majority element is an element that appears more than N/2 times in an array
# of length N.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: nums = [2,4,5,5,5,5,5,6,6], target = 5
# Output: true
# Explanation: 
# The value 5 appears 5 times and the length of the array is 9.
# Thus, 5 is a majority element because 5 > 9/2 is true.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: nums = [10,100,101,101], target = 101
# Output: false
# Explanation: 
# The value 101 appears 2 times and the length of the array is 4.
# Thus, 101 is not a majority element because 2 > 4/2 is false.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# 1 <= nums.length <= 1000
# 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
# 1 <= target <= 10^9
#
