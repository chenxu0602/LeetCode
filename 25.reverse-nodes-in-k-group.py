#
# Given a linked list, reverse the nodes of a linked list k at a time and
# return its modified list.
# 
# k is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked
# list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then left-out nodes in
# the end should remain as it is.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Example:
# 
# Given this linked list: 1->2->3->4->5
# 
# For k = 2, you should return: 2->1->4->3->5
# 
# For k = 3, you should return: 3->2->1->4->5
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# Only constant extra memory is allowed.
# You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes itself may be
# changed.
