# Testcase Example:  '[[1,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,1]]'
#
# Given a 2D integer matrix M representing the gray scale of an image, you need
# to design a smoother to make the gray scale of each cell becomes the average
# gray scale (rounding down) of all the 8 surrounding cells and itself.  If a
# cell has less than 8 surrounding cells, then use as many as you can.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# Input:
# [[1,1,1],
# ⁠[1,0,1],
# ⁠[1,1,1]]
# Output:
# [[0, 0, 0],
# ⁠[0, 0, 0],
# ⁠[0, 0, 0]]
# Explanation:
# For the point (0,0), (0,2), (2,0), (2,2): floor(3/4) = floor(0.75) = 0
# For the point (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1): floor(5/6) = floor(0.83333333) = 0
# For the point (1,1): floor(8/9) = floor(0.88888889) = 0
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# The value in the given matrix is in the range of [0, 255].
# The length and width of the given matrix are in the range of [1, 150].

                            ans[r][c] += M[nr][nc]
                            count += 1
                if count:
                    ans[r][c] //= count
