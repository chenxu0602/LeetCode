#
# You have N bulbs in a row numbered from 1 to N. Initially, all the bulbs are
# turned off. We turn on exactly one bulb everyday until all bulbs are on after
# N days.
# 
# You are given an array bulbs of length N where bulbs[i] = x means that on the
# (i+1)th day, we will turn on the bulb at position x where i is 0-indexed and
# x is 1-indexed.
# 
# Given an integer K, find out the minimum day number such that there exists
# two turned on bulbs that have exactly K bulbs between them that are all
# turned off.
# 
# If there isn't such day, return -1.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: 
# bulbs: [1,3,2]
# K: 1
# Output: 2
# Explanation:
# On the first day: bulbs[0] = 1, first bulb is turned on: [1,0,0]
# On the second day: bulbs[1] = 3, third bulb is turned on: [1,0,1]
# On the third day: bulbs[2] = 2, second bulb is turned on: [1,1,1]
# We return 2 because on the second day, there were two on bulbs with one off
# bulb between them.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: 
# bulbs: [1,2,3]
# K: 1
# Output: -1
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# 1 <= N <= 20000
# 1 <= bulbs[i] <= N
# bulbs is a permutation of numbers from 1 to N.
# 0 <= K <= 20000
#
