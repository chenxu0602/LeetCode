#
# We have two types of tiles: a 2x1 domino shape, and an "L" tromino shape.
# These shapes may be rotated.
# 
# 
# XX  <- domino
# 
# XX  <- "L" tromino
# X
# 
# 
# Given N, how many ways are there to tile a 2 x N board? Return your answer
# modulo 10^9 + 7.
# 
# (In a tiling, every square must be covered by a tile. Two tilings are
# different if and only if there are two 4-directionally adjacent cells on the
# board such that exactly one of the tilings has both squares occupied by a
# tile.)
# 
# 
# 
# Example:
# Input: 3
# Output: 5
# Explanation: 
# The five different ways are listed below, different letters indicates
# different tiles:
# XYZ XXZ XYY XXY XYY
# XYZ YYZ XZZ XYY XXY
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# NÂ  will be in range [1, 1000].
