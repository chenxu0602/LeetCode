#
# X is a good number if after rotating each digit individually by 180 degrees,
# we get a valid number that is different from X.  Each digit must be rotated -
# we cannot choose to leave it alone.
# 
# A number is valid if each digit remains a digit after rotation. 0, 1, and 8
# rotate to themselves; 2 and 5 rotate to each other; 6 and 9 rotate to each
# other, and the rest of the numbers do not rotate to any other number and
# become invalid.
# 
# Now given a positive number N, how many numbers X from 1 to N are good?
# 
# 
# Example:
# Input: 10
# Output: 4
# Explanation: 
# There are four good numbers in the range [1, 10] : 2, 5, 6, 9.
# Note that 1 and 10 are not good numbers, since they remain unchanged after
# rotating.
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# N  will be in range [1, 10000].
