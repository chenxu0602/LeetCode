#
# Given a text string and words (a list of strings), return all index pairs [i,
# j] so that the substring text[i]...text[j] is in the list of words.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: text = "thestoryofleetcodeandme", words = ["story","fleet","leetcode"]
# Output: [[3,7],[9,13],[10,17]]
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: text = "ababa", words = ["aba","ab"]
# Output: [[0,1],[0,2],[2,3],[2,4]]
# Explanation: 
# Notice that matches can overlap, see "aba" is found in [0,2] and [2,4].
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# All strings contains only lowercase English letters.
# It's guaranteed that all strings in words are different.
# 1 <= text.length <= 100
# 1 <= words.length <= 20
# 1 <= words[i].length <= 50
# Return the pairs [i,j] in sorted order (i.e. sort them by their first
# coordinate in case of ties sort them by their second coordinate).
#
