#
# We are given some website visits: the user with name username[i] visited the
# website website[i] at time timestamp[i].
# 
# A 3-sequence is a list of websites of length 3 sorted in ascending order by
# the time of their visits.  (The websites in a 3-sequence are not necessarily
# distinct.)
# 
# Find the 3-sequence visited by the largest number of users. If there is more
# than one solution, return the lexicographically smallest such 3-sequence.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: username =
# ["joe","joe","joe","james","james","james","james","mary","mary","mary"],
# timestamp = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], website =
# ["home","about","career","home","cart","maps","home","home","about","career"]
# Output: ["home","about","career"]
# Explanation: 
# The tuples in this example are:
# ["joe", 1, "home"]
# ["joe", 2, "about"]
# ["joe", 3, "career"]
# ["james", 4, "home"]
# ["james", 5, "cart"]
# ["james", 6, "maps"]
# ["james", 7, "home"]
# ["mary", 8, "home"]
# ["mary", 9, "about"]
# ["mary", 10, "career"]
# The 3-sequence ("home", "about", "career") was visited at least once by 2
# users.
# The 3-sequence ("home", "cart", "maps") was visited at least once by 1 user.
# The 3-sequence ("home", "cart", "home") was visited at least once by 1 user.
# The 3-sequence ("home", "maps", "home") was visited at least once by 1 user.
# The 3-sequence ("cart", "maps", "home") was visited at least once by 1
# user.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# 3 <= N = username.length = timestamp.length = website.length <= 50
# 1 <= username[i].length <= 10
# 0 <= timestamp[i] <= 10^9
# 1 <= website[i].length <= 10
# Both username[i] and website[i] contain only lowercase characters.
# It is guaranteed that there is at least one user who visited at least 3
# websites.
# No user visits two websites at the same time.
#
