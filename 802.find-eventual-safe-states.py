# In a directed graph, we start at some node and every turn, walk along a
# directed edge of the graph.  If we reach a node that is terminal (that is, it
# has no outgoing directed edges), we stop.
# 
# Now, say our starting node is eventually safe if and only if we must
# eventually walk to a terminal node.  More specifically, there exists a
# natural number K so that for any choice of where to walk, we must have
# stopped at a terminal node in less than K steps.
# 
# Which nodes are eventually safe?  Return them as an array in sorted order.
# 
# The directed graph has N nodes with labels 0, 1, ..., N-1, where N is the
# length of graph.  The graph is given in the following form: graph[i] is a
# list of labels j such that (i, j) is a directed edge of the graph.
# 
# 
# Example:
# Input: graph = [[1,2],[2,3],[5],[0],[5],[],[]]
# Output: [2,4,5,6]
# Here is a diagram of the above graph.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# graph will have length at most 10000.
# The number of edges in the graph will not exceed 32000.
# Each graph[i] will be a sorted list of different integers, chosen within the
# range [0, graph.length - 1].
