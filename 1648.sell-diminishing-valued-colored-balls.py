#
# You have an inventory of different colored balls, and there is a customer
# that wants orders balls of any color.
# 
# The customer weirdly values the colored balls. Each colored ball's value is
# the number of balls of that colorÂ you currently have in your inventory. For
# example, if you own 6 yellow balls, the customer would pay 6 for the first
# yellow ball. After the transaction, there are only 5 yellow balls left, so
# the next yellow ball is then valued at 5 (i.e., the value of the balls
# decreases as you sell more to the customer).
# 
# You are given an integer array, inventory, where inventory[i] represents the
# number of balls of the i^th color that you initially own. You are also given
# an integer orders, which represents the total number of balls that the
# customer wants. You can sell the balls in any order.
# 
# Return the maximum total value that you can attain after selling orders
# colored balls. As the answer may be too large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: inventory = [2,5], orders = 4
# Output: 14
# Explanation: Sell the 1st color 1 time (2) and the 2nd color 3 times (5 + 4 +
# 3).
# The maximum total value is 2 + 5 + 4 + 3 = 14.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: inventory = [3,5], orders = 6
# Output: 19
# Explanation: Sell the 1st color 2 times (3 + 2) and the 2nd color 4 times (5
# + 4 + 3 + 2).
# The maximum total value is 3 + 2 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 19.
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: inventory = [2,8,4,10,6], orders = 20
# Output: 110
# 
# 
# Example 4:
# 
# 
# Input: inventory = [1000000000], orders = 1000000000
# Output: 21
# Explanation: Sell the 1st color 1000000000 times for a total value of
# 500000000500000000. 500000000500000000 modulo 10^9 + 7 = 21.
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 1 <= inventory.length <= 10^5
# 1 <= inventory[i] <= 10^9
# 1 <= orders <= min(sum(inventory[i]), 10^9)
#
