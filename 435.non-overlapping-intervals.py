# Testcase Example:  '[[1,2]]'
#
# Given a collection of intervals, find the minimum number of intervals you
# need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# You may assume the interval's end point is always bigger than its start
# point.
# Intervals like [1,2] and [2,3] have borders "touching" but they don't overlap
# each other.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: [ [1,2], [2,3], [3,4], [1,3] ]
# 
# Output: 1
# 
# Explanation: [1,3] can be removed and the rest of intervals are
# non-overlapping.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: [ [1,2], [1,2], [1,2] ]
# 
# Output: 2
# 
# Explanation: You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of intervals
# non-overlapping.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: [ [1,2], [2,3] ]
# 
# Output: 0
# 
# Explanation: You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're
# already non-overlapping.

# default code definition to get new method signature.
