# Testcase Example:  '"abcd"\n2'
#
# Given a string s, a k duplicate removal consists of choosing k adjacent and
# equal letters from s and removing them causing the left and the right side of
# the deleted substring to concatenate together.
# 
# We repeatedly make k duplicate removals on s until we no longer can.
# 
# Return the final string after all such duplicate removals have been made.
# 
# It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: s = "abcd", k = 2
# Output: "abcd"
# Explanation: There's nothing to delete.
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: s = "deeedbbcccbdaa", k = 3
# Output: "aa"
# Explanation: 
# First delete "eee" and "ccc", get "ddbbbdaa"
# Then delete "bbb", get "dddaa"
# Finally delete "ddd", get "aa"
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: s = "pbbcggttciiippooaais", k = 2
# Output: "ps"
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 1 <= s.length <= 10^5
# 2 <= k <= 10^4
# s only contains lower case English letters.
# 
#

class Solution:

                    stack.pop()
            else:
                stack.append([c, 1])

        return "".join(c * k for c, k in stack)
