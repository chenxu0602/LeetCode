# You have a pointer at index 0 in an array of size arrLen. At each step, you
# can move 1 position to the left, 1 position to the right in the array or stay
# in the same place  (The pointer should not be placed outside the array at any
# time).
# 
# Given two integers steps and arrLen, return the number of ways such that your
# pointer still at index 0 after exactly steps steps.
# 
# Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: steps = 3, arrLen = 2
# Output: 4
# Explanation: There are 4 differents ways to stay at index 0 after 3 steps.
# Right, Left, Stay
# Stay, Right, Left
# Right, Stay, Left
# Stay, Stay, Stay
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: steps = 2, arrLen = 4
# Output: 2
# Explanation: There are 2 differents ways to stay at index 0 after 2 steps
# Right, Left
# Stay, Stay
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: steps = 4, arrLen = 2
# Output: 8
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 1 <= steps <= 500
# 1 <= arrLen <= 10^6
