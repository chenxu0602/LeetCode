# Testcase Example:  '[2,7,11,15]\n[1,10,4,11]'
#
# Given two arrays A and B of equal size, the advantage of A with respect to B
# is the number of indices iÂ for which A[i] > B[i].
# 
# Return any permutation of A that maximizes its advantage with respect to
# B.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: A = [2,7,11,15], B = [1,10,4,11]
# Output: [2,11,7,15]
# 
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: A = [12,24,8,32], B = [13,25,32,11]
# Output: [24,32,8,12]
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# 1 <= A.length = B.length <= 10000
# 0 <= A[i] <= 10^9
# 0 <= B[i] <= 10^9
