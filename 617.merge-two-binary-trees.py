#
# Given two binary trees and imagine that when you put one of them to cover the
# other, some nodes of the two trees are overlapped while the others are not.
# 
# You need to merge them into a new binary tree. The merge rule is that if two
# nodes overlap, then sum node values up as the new value of the merged node.
# Otherwise, the NOT null node will be used as the node of new tree.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: 
# Tree 1                     Tree 2                  
# ⁠         1                         2                             
# ⁠        / \                       / \                            
# ⁠       3   2                     1   3                        
# ⁠      /                           \   \                      
# ⁠     5                             4   7                  
# Output: 
# Merged tree:
# 3
# / \
# 4   5
# / \   \ 
# 5   4   7
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Note: The merging process must start from the root nodes of both trees.

# Definition for a binary tree node.
