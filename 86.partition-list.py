#
# Given a linked list and a value x, partition it such that all nodes less than
# x come before nodes greater than or equal to x.
# 
# You should preserve the original relative order of the nodes in each of the
# two partitions.
# 
# Example:
# 
# 
# Input: head = 1->4->3->2->5->2, x = 3
# Output: 1->2->2->4->3->5
# 
# 
#

# @lc code=start
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def partition(self, head: ListNode, x: int) -> ListNode:
        h1 = l1 = ListNode(0)
        h2 = l2 = ListNode(0)
        while head:
            if head.val < x:
                l1.next = head
                l1 = l1.next
            else:
                l2.next = head
                l2 = l2.next
            head = head.next
        l2.next = None
        l1.next = h2.next
        return h1.next
