# Testcase Example:  '[1,3,5,4,7]'
#
# 
# Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest continuous
# increasing subsequence (subarray).
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# Input: [1,3,5,4,7]
# Output: 3
# Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [1,3,5], its
# length is 3. 
# Even though [1,3,5,7] is also an increasing subsequence, it's not a
# continuous one where 5 and 7 are separated by 4. 
# 
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# Input: [2,2,2,2,2]
# Output: 1
# Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [2], its length
# is 1. 
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# Length of the array will not exceed 10,000.
