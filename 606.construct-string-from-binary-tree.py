#
# You need to construct a string consists of parenthesis and integers from a
# binary tree with the preorder traversing way.
# 
# The null node needs to be represented by empty parenthesis pair "()". And you
# need to omit all the empty parenthesis pairs that don't affect the one-to-one
# mapping relationship between the string and the original binary tree.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# Input: Binary tree: [1,2,3,4]
# ⁠      1
# ⁠    /   \
# ⁠   2     3
# ⁠  /    
# ⁠ 4     
# 
# Output: "1(2(4))(3)"
# Explanation: Originallay it needs to be "1(2(4)())(3()())", but you need to
# omit all the unnecessary empty parenthesis pairs. And it will be
# "1(2(4))(3)".
# 
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# Input: Binary tree: [1,2,3,null,4]
# ⁠      1
# ⁠    /   \
# ⁠   2     3
# ⁠    \  
# ⁠     4 
# 
# Output: "1(2()(4))(3)"
# Explanation: Almost the same as the first example, except we can't omit the
# first parenthesis pair to break the one-to-one mapping relationship between
# the input and the output.

# @lc code=start
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def tree2str(self, t: TreeNode) -> str:
        # Using Recursion 
        # Time  complexity: O(n)
        # Space complexity: O(n)
        if not t:
            return ""
        if not t.left and not t.right:
            return str(t.val)
        if not t.right:
            return str(t.val) + '(' + self.tree2str(t.left) + ')'
        return str(t.val) + '(' + self.tree2str(t.left) + ')(' + self.tree2str(t.right) + ')'
