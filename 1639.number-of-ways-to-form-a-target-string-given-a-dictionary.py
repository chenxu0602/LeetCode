#
# You are given a list of strings of the same length words and a string
# target.
# 
# Your task is to form target using the given words under the following
# rules:
# 
# 
# target should be formed from left to right.
# To form the i^th character (0-indexed) of target, you can choose the k^th
# character of the j^th string in words if target[i] = words[j][k].
# Once you use the k^th character of the j^th string of words, you can no
# longer use the x^th character of any string in words where x <= k. In other
# words, all characters to the left of or at index k become unusuable for every
# string.
# Repeat the process until you form the string target.
# 
# 
# NoticeÂ that you can use multiple characters from the same string in words
# provided the conditions above are met.
# 
# Return the number of ways to form target from words. Since the answer may be
# too large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: words = ["acca","bbbb","caca"], target = "aba"
# Output: 6
# Explanation: There are 6 ways to form target.
# "aba" -> index 0 ("acca"), index 1 ("bbbb"), index 3 ("caca")
# "aba" -> index 0 ("acca"), index 2 ("bbbb"), index 3 ("caca")
# "aba" -> index 0 ("acca"), index 1 ("bbbb"), index 3 ("acca")
# "aba" -> index 0 ("acca"), index 2 ("bbbb"), index 3 ("acca")
# "aba" -> index 1 ("caca"), index 2 ("bbbb"), index 3 ("acca")
# "aba" -> index 1 ("caca"), index 2 ("bbbb"), index 3 ("caca")
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: words = ["abba","baab"], target = "bab"
# Output: 4
# Explanation: There are 4 ways to form target.
# "bab" -> index 0 ("baab"), index 1 ("baab"), index 2 ("abba")
# "bab" -> index 0 ("baab"), index 1 ("baab"), index 3 ("baab")
# "bab" -> index 0 ("baab"), index 2 ("baab"), index 3 ("baab")
# "bab" -> index 1 ("abba"), index 2 ("baab"), index 3 ("baab")
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: words = ["abcd"], target = "abcd"
# Output: 1
# 
# 
# Example 4:
# 
# 
# Input: words = ["abab","baba","abba","baab"], target = "abba"
# Output: 16
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 1 <= words.length <= 1000
# 1 <= words[i].length <= 1000
# All strings in words have the same length.
# 1 <= target.length <= 1000
# words[i] and target contain only lowercase English letters.
