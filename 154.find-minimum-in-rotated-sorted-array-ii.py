# Testcase Example:  '[1,3,5]'
#
# Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown
# to you beforehand.
# 
# (i.e.,  [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become  [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).
# 
# Find the minimum element.
# 
# The array may contain duplicates.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: [1,3,5]
# Output: 1
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: [2,2,2,0,1]
# Output: 0
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# This is a follow up problem to Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array.
# Would allow duplicates affect the run-time complexity? How and why?

class Solution:
    def findMin(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:

        low, high = 0, len(nums) - 1
        while low < high:
            mid = low + (high - low) // 2

            if nums[mid] > nums[high]:
                low = mid + 1
            elif nums[mid] < nums[high]:
                high = mid
            else:
                high -= 1

        return nums[low]
