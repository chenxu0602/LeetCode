#
# You have a number of envelopes with widths and heights given as a pair of
# integers (w, h). One envelope can fit into another if and only if both the
# width and height of one envelope is greater than the width and height of the
# other envelope.
# 
# What is the maximum number of envelopes can you Russian doll? (put one inside
# other)

# 
# Input: [[5,4],[6,4],[6,7],[2,3]]
# Output: 3 
# Explanation: The maximum number of envelopes you can Russian doll is 3 ([2,3]
# => [5,4] => [6,7]).
