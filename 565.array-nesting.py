# Testcase Example:  '[5,4,0,3,1,6,2]'
#
# A zero-indexed array A of length N contains all integers from 0 to N-1. Find
# and return the longest length of set S, where S[i] = {A[i], A[A[i]],
# A[A[A[i]]], ... } subjected to the rule below.
# 
# Suppose the first element in S starts with the selection of element A[i] of
# index = i, the next element in S should be A[A[i]], and then A[A[A[i]]]â€¦ By
# that analogy, we stop adding right before a duplicate element occurs in
# S.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: A = [5,4,0,3,1,6,2]
# Output: 4
# Explanation: 
# A[0] = 5, A[1] = 4, A[2] = 0, A[3] = 3, A[4] = 1, A[5] = 6, A[6] = 2.
# 
# One of the longest S[K]:
# S[0] = {A[0], A[5], A[6], A[2]} = {5, 6, 2, 0}
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# N is an integer within the range [1, 20,000].
# The elements of A are all distinct.
# Each element of A is an integer within the range [0, N-1].
