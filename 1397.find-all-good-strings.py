# Testcase Example:  '2\n"aa"\n"da"\n"b"'
#
# Given the strings s1 and s2 of size n, and the string evil. Return the number
# of good strings.
# 
# A good string has size n, it is alphabetically greater than or equal to s1,
# it is alphabetically smaller than or equal to s2, and it does not contain the
# string evil as a substring. Since the answer can be a huge number, return
# this modulo 10^9 + 7.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: n = 2, s1 = "aa", s2 = "da", evil = "b"
# Output: 51 
# Explanation: There are 25 good strings starting with 'a':
# "aa","ac","ad",...,"az". Then there are 25 good strings starting with 'c':
# "ca","cc","cd",...,"cz" and finally there is one good string starting with
# 'd': "da".Â 
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: n = 8, s1 = "leetcode", s2 = "leetgoes", evil = "leet"
# Output: 0 
# Explanation: All strings greater than or equal to s1 and smaller than or
# equal to s2 start with the prefix "leet", therefore, there is not any good
# string.
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: n = 2, s1 = "gx", s2 = "gz", evil = "x"
# Output: 2
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# s1.length == n
# s2.length == n
# s1 <= s2
# 1 <= n <= 500
# 1 <= evil.length <= 50
# All strings consist of lowercase English letters.
