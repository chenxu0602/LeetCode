# Design a Skiplist without using any built-in libraries.
# 
# A Skiplist is a data structure that takes O(log(n)) time to add, erase and
# search. Comparing with treap and red-black tree which has the same function
# and performance, the code length of Skiplist can be comparatively short and
# the idea behind Skiplists are just simple linked lists.
# 
# For example: we have a Skiplist containing [30,40,50,60,70,90] and we want to
# add 80 and 45 into it. The Skiplist works this way:

# 
# You can see there are many layers in the Skiplist. Each layer is a sorted
# linked list. With the help of the top layers, add , erase and search can be
# faster than O(n). It can be proven that the average time complexity for each
# operation is O(log(n)) and space complexity is O(n).
# 
# To be specific, your design should include these functions:
# 
# 
# bool search(int target) : Return whether the target exists in the Skiplist or
# not.
# void add(int num): Insert a value into the SkipList. 
# bool erase(int num): Remove a value in the Skiplist. If num does not exist in
# the Skiplist, do nothing and return false. If there exists multiple num
# values, removing any one of them is fine.
# 
# 
# See more about Skiplist : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skip_list
# 
# Note that duplicates may exist in the Skiplist, your code needs to handle
# this situation.
# 
# 
# 
# Example:
# 
# 
# Skiplist skiplist = new Skiplist();
# 
# skiplist.add(1);
# skiplist.add(2);
# skiplist.add(3);
# skiplist.search(0);   // return false.
# skiplist.add(4);
# skiplist.search(1);   // return true.
# skiplist.erase(0);    // return false, 0 is not in skiplist.
# skiplist.erase(1);    // return true.
# skiplist.search(1);   // return false, 1 has already been erased.
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 0 <= num, target <= 20000
# At most 50000 calls will be made to search, add, and erase.
