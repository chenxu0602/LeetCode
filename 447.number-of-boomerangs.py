#
# Given n points in the plane that are all pairwise distinct, a "boomerang" is
# a tuple of points (i, j, k) such that the distance between i and j equals the
# distance between i and k (the order of the tuple matters).
# 
# Find the number of boomerangs. You may assume that n will be at most 500 and
# coordinates of points are all in the range [-10000, 10000] (inclusive).
# 
# Example:
# 
# 
# Input:
# [[0,0],[1,0],[2,0]]
# 
# Output:
# 2
# 
# Explanation:
# The two boomerangs are [[1,0],[0,0],[2,0]] and [[1,0],[2,0],[0,0]]
