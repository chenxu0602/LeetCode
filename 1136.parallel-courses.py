# Testcase Example:  '3\n[[1,3],[2,3]]'
#
# There are N courses, labelled from 1 to N.
# 
# We are given relations[i] = [X, Y], representing a prerequisite relationship
# between course X and course Y: course X has to be studied before course Y.
# 
# In one semester you can study any number of courses as long as you have
# studied all the prerequisites for the course you are studying.
# 
# Return the minimum number of semesters needed to study all courses.  If there
# is no way to study all the courses, return -1.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Input: N = 3, relations = [[1,3],[2,3]]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: 
# In the first semester, courses 1 and 2 are studied. In the second semester,
# course 3 is studied.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Input: N = 3, relations = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,1]]
# Output: -1
# Explanation: 
# No course can be studied because they depend on each other.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# 1 <= N <= 5000
# 1 <= relations.length <= 5000
# relations[i][0] != relations[i][1]
# There are no repeated relations in the input.
