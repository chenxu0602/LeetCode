# Testcase Example:  '[2,2,1,1,5,3,3,5]'
#
# Given an array numsÂ of positive integers, return the longest possible length
# of an array prefix of nums, such that it is possible to remove exactly one
# element from this prefix so that every number that has appeared in it will
# have the same number of occurrences.
# 
# If after removing one element there are no remaining elements, it's still
# considered that every appeared number has the same number of ocurrences
# (0).
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,5,3,3,5]
# Output: 7
# Explanation: For the subarray [2,2,1,1,5,3,3] of length 7, if we remove
# nums[4]=5, we will get [2,2,1,1,3,3], so that each number will appear exactly
# twice.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,3,4,4,4,5]
# Output: 13
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,2]
# Output: 5
# 
# 
# Example 4:
# 
# 
# Input: nums = [10,2,8,9,3,8,1,5,2,3,7,6]
# Output: 8
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 2 <= nums.length <= 10^5
# 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5
#
