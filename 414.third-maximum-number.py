#
# Given a non-empty array of integers, return the third maximum number in this
# array. If it does not exist, return the maximum number. The time complexity
# must be in O(n).
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# Input: [3, 2, 1]
# 
# Output: 1
# 
# Explanation: The third maximum is 1.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# Input: [1, 2]
# 
# Output: 2
# 
# Explanation: The third maximum does not exist, so the maximum (2) is returned
# instead.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# Input: [2, 2, 3, 1]
# 
# Output: 1
# 
# Explanation: Note that the third maximum here means the third maximum
# distinct number.
# Both numbers with value 2 are both considered as second maximum.
#

class Solution:
    def thirdMax(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # Time  complexity: O(n)
        # Space complexity: O(1)
        nums = set(nums)
        for i in range((2, 0)[len(nums) < 3]):
            nums.remove(max(nums))
        return max(nums)
