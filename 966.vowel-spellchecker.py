#
# Given a wordlist, we want to implement a spellchecker that converts a query
# word into a correct word.
# 
# For a given query word, the spell checker handles two categories of spelling
# mistakes:
# 
# 
# Capitalization: If the query matches a word in the wordlist
# (case-insensitive), then the query word is returned with the same case as the
# case in the wordlist.
# 
# 
# Example: wordlist = ["yellow"], query = "YellOw": correct = "yellow"
# Example: wordlist = ["Yellow"], query = "yellow": correct = "Yellow"
# Example: wordlist = ["yellow"], query = "yellow": correct =
# "yellow"
# 
# 
# Vowel Errors: If after replacing the vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u') of the
# query word with any vowel individually, it matches a word in the wordlist
# (case-insensitive), then the query word is returned with the same case as the
# match in the wordlist.
# 
# Example: wordlist = ["YellOw"], query = "yollow": correct = "YellOw"
# Example: wordlist = ["YellOw"], query = "yeellow": correct = "" (no
# match)
# Example: wordlist = ["YellOw"], query = "yllw": correct = "" (no
# match)
# 
# 
# 
# 
# In addition, the spell checker operates under the following precedence
# rules:
# 
# 
# When the query exactly matches a word in the wordlist (case-sensitive), you
# should return the same word back.
# When the query matches a word up to capitlization, you should return the
# first such match in the wordlist.
# When the query matches a word up to vowel errors, you should return the first
# such match in the wordlist.
# If the query has no matches in the wordlist, you should return the empty
# string.
# 
# 
# Given some queries, return a list of words answer, where answer[i] is the
# correct word for query = queries[i].
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: wordlist = ["KiTe","kite","hare","Hare"], queries =
# ["kite","Kite","KiTe","Hare","HARE","Hear","hear","keti","keet","keto"]
# Output: ["kite","KiTe","KiTe","Hare","hare","","","KiTe","","KiTe"]
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# 1 <= wordlist.length <= 5000
# 1 <= queries.length <= 5000
# 1 <= wordlist[i].length <= 7
# 1 <= queries[i].length <= 7
# All strings in wordlist and queries consist only of english letters.
# 
#

class Solution:
    def spellchecker(self, wordlist: List[str], queries: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        # O(C) where C is the total content of wordlist and queries.
        
        def devowel(word):
            return "".join('*' if c in 'aeiou' else c for c in word)
