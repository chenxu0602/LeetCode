#
# Given a rooted binary tree, return the lowest common ancestor of its deepest
# leaves.
# 
# Recall that:
# 
# 
# The node of a binary tree is a leaf if and only if it has no children
# The depth of the root of the tree is 0, and if the depth of a node is d, the
# depth of each of its children is d+1.
# The lowest common ancestor of a set S of nodes is the node A with the largest
# depth such that every node in S is in the subtree with root A.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: root = [1,2,3]
# Output: [1,2,3]
# Explanation: 
# The deepest leaves are the nodes with values 2 and 3.
# The lowest common ancestor of these leaves is the node with value 1.
# The answer returned is a TreeNode object (not an array) with serialization
# "[1,2,3]".
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: root = [1,2,3,4]
# Output: [4]
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5]
# Output: [2,4,5]
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# The given tree will have between 1 and 1000 nodes.
# Each node of the tree will have a distinct value between 1 and 1000.
# 
#

# @lc code=start
# Definition for a binary tree node.

#     def __init__(self, x):
