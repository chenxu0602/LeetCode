# Testcase Example:  '"eleetminicoworoep"'
#
# Given the string s, return the size of the longest substring containing each
# vowel an even number of times. That is, 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u' must
# appear an even number of times.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: s = "eleetminicoworoep"
# Output: 13
# Explanation: The longest substring is "leetminicowor" which contains two each
# of the vowels: e, i and o and zero of the vowels: a and u.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: s = "leetcodeisgreat"
# Output: 5
# Explanation: The longest substring is "leetc" which contains two e's.
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: s = "bcbcbc"
# Output: 6
# Explanation: In this case, the given string "bcbcbc" is the longest because
# all vowels: a, e, i, o and u appear zero times.
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 1 <= s.length <= 5 x 10^5
# sÂ contains only lowercase English letters.

class Solution:
    def findTheLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:

        # seen = {0: -1}
        # res = cur = 0

        # for i, c in enumerate(s):
        #     cur ^= 1 << ("aeiou".find(c) + 1) >> 1
        #     seen.setdefault(cur, i)
        #     res = max(res, i - seen[cur])

        # return res


        vowels = {'a': 1, 'e': 2, 'i': 4, 'o': 8, 'u': 16}
        d, n, r = {0: -1}, 0, 0

        for i, c in enumerate(s):
            if c in vowels:
                n ^= vowels[c]
            if n not in d:
                d[n] = i
            else:
                r = max(r, i - d[n])

        return r
