# Testcase Example:  '[4,1,2]\n[1,3,4,2]'
#
# 
# You are given two arrays (without duplicates) nums1 and nums2 where nums1’s
# elements are subset of nums2. Find all the next greater numbers for nums1's
# elements in the corresponding places of nums2. 
# 
# 
# 
# The Next Greater Number of a number x in nums1 is the first greater number to
# its right in nums2. If it does not exist, output -1 for this number.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# Input: nums1 = [4,1,2], nums2 = [1,3,4,2].
# Output: [-1,3,-1]
# Explanation:
# ⁠   For number 4 in the first array, you cannot find the next greater number
# for it in the second array, so output -1.
# ⁠   For number 1 in the first array, the next greater number for it in the
# second array is 3.
# ⁠   For number 2 in the first array, there is no next greater number for it
# in the second array, so output -1.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# Input: nums1 = [2,4], nums2 = [1,2,3,4].
# Output: [3,-1]
# Explanation:
# ⁠   For number 2 in the first array, the next greater number for it in the
# second array is 3.
# ⁠   For number 4 in the first array, there is no next greater number for it
# in the second array, so output -1.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# All elements in nums1 and nums2 are unique.
# The length of both nums1 and nums2 would not exceed 1000.

class Solution:
    def nextGreaterElement(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        # Time  complexity: O(m + n)
        # Space complexity: O(m + n)
        stack, dic, res = [], {}, []

        for num in nums2:
            while stack and num > stack[-1]:
                dic[stack.pop()] = num
            stack.append(num)

        for num in nums1:
            if num in dic:
                res.append(dic[num])
            else:
                res.append(-1)

        return res
