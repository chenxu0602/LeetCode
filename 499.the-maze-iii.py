#
# There is a ball in a maze with empty spaces and walls. The ball can go
# through empty spaces by rolling up (u), down (d), left (l) or right (r), but
# it won't stop rolling until hitting a wall. When the ball stops, it could
# choose the next direction. There is also a hole in this maze. The ball will
# drop into the hole if it rolls on to the hole.
# 
# Given the ball position, the hole position and the maze, find out how the
# ball could drop into the hole by moving the shortest distance. The distance
# is defined by the number of empty spaces traveled by the ball from the start
# position (excluded) to the hole (included). Output the moving directions by
# using 'u', 'd', 'l' and 'r'. Since there could be several different shortest
# ways, you should output the lexicographically smallest way. If the ball
# cannot reach the hole, output "impossible".
# 
# The maze is represented by a binary 2D array. 1 means the wall and 0 means
# the empty space. You may assume that the borders of the maze are all walls.
# The ball and the hole coordinates are represented by row and column
# indexes.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input 1: a maze represented by a 2D array
# 
# 0 0 0 0 0
# 1 1 0 0 1
# 0 0 0 0 0
# 0 1 0 0 1
# 0 1 0 0 0
# 
# Input 2: ball coordinate (rowBall, colBall) = (4, 3)
# Input 3: hole coordinate (rowHole, colHole) = (0, 1)
# 
# Output: "lul"
# 
# Explanation: There are two shortest ways for the ball to drop into the hole.
# The first way is left -> up -> left, represented by "lul".
# The second way is up -> left, represented by 'ul'.
# Both ways have shortest distance 6, but the first way is lexicographically
# smaller because 'l' < 'u'. So the output is "lul".
# 
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input 1: a maze represented by a 2D array
# 
# 0 0 0 0 0
# 1 1 0 0 1
# 0 0 0 0 0
# 0 1 0 0 1
# 0 1 0 0 0
# 
# Input 2: ball coordinate (rowBall, colBall) = (4, 3)
# Input 3: hole coordinate (rowHole, colHole) = (3, 0)
# 
# Output: "impossible"
# 
# Explanation: The ball cannot reach the hole.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# There is only one ball and one hole in the maze.
# Both the ball and hole exist on an empty space, and they will not be at the
# same position initially.
# The given maze does not contain border (like the red rectangle in the example
# pictures), but you could assume the border of the maze are all walls.
# The maze contains at least 2 empty spaces, and the width and the height of
# the maze won't exceed 30.
