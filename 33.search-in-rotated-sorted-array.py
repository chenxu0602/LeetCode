# Testcase Example:  '[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]\n0'
#
# Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown
# to you beforehand.
# 
# (i.e., [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).
# 
# You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its
# index, otherwise return -1.
# 
# You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.
# 
# Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order ofÂ O(logÂ n).
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
# Output: 4
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
# Output: -1
#

class Solution:
    def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:

        start, end = 0, len(nums)-1
        while start <= end:
            mid = start + (end - start) // 2
            if nums[mid] == target:
                return mid
            elif nums[mid] >= nums[start]:
                if target >= nums[start] and target < nums[mid]:
                    end = mid - 1
                else:
                    start = mid + 1
            else:
                if nums[mid] < target <= nums[end]:
                    start = mid + 1
                else:
                    end = mid - 1
        return -1
