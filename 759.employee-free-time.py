# Testcase Example:  '[[{"$id":"1","start":1,"end":2},{"$id":"2","start":5,"end":6}],[{"$id":"3","start":1,"end":3}],[{"$id":"4","start":4,"end":10}]]'
#
# We are given a list schedule of employees, which represents the working time
# for each employee.
# 
# Each employee has a list of non-overlapping Intervals, and these intervals
# are in sorted order.
# 
# Return the list of finite intervals representing common, positive-length free
# time for all employees, also in sorted order.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: schedule = [[[1,2],[5,6]],[[1,3]],[[4,10]]]
# Output: [[3,4]]
# Explanation:
# There are a total of three employees, and all common
# free time intervals would be [-inf, 1], [3, 4], [10, inf].
# We discard any intervals that contain inf as they aren't finite.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: schedule = [[[1,3],[6,7]],[[2,4]],[[2,5],[9,12]]]
# Output: [[5,6],[7,9]]
# 
# 
# 
# 
# (Even though we are representing Intervals in the form [x, y], the objects
# inside are Intervals, not lists or arrays. For example, schedule[0][0].start
# = 1, schedule[0][0].end = 2, and schedule[0][0][0] is not defined.)
# 
# Also, we wouldn't include intervals like [5, 5] in our answer, as they have
# zero length.
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# schedule and schedule[i] are lists with lengths in range [1, 50].
# 0 <= schedule[i].start < schedule[i].end <= 10^8.
# 
# 
# NOTE:Â input types have been changed on June 17, 2019. Please reset to default
# code definition to get new method signature.
