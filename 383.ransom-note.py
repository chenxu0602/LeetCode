# Given an arbitrary ransom note string and another string containing letters
# from all the magazines, write a function that will return true if the ransom 
# note can be constructed from the magazines ; otherwise, it will return
# false. 
# 
# 
# Each letter in the magazine string can only be used once in your ransom
# note.
# 
# 
# Note:
# You may assume that both strings contain only lowercase letters.
