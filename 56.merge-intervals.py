# Testcase Example:  '[[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]'
#
# Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
# Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
# Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlaps, merge them into
# [1,6].
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: [[1,4],[4,5]]
# Output: [[1,5]]
# Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.
