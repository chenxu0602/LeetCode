# Testcase Example:  '"horse"\n"ros"'
#
# Given two words word1 and word2, find the minimum number of operations
# required to convert word1 to word2.
# 
# You have the following 3 operations permitted on a word:
# 
# 
# Insert a character
# Delete a character
# Replace a character
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: word1 = "horse", word2 = "ros"
# Output: 3
# Explanation: 
# horse -> rorse (replace 'h' with 'r')
# rorse -> rose (remove 'r')
# rose -> ros (remove 'e')
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: word1 = "intention", word2 = "execution"
# Output: 5
# Explanation: 
# intention -> inention (remove 't')
# inention -> enention (replace 'i' with 'e')
# enention -> exention (replace 'n' with 'x')
# exention -> exection (replace 'n' with 'c')
# exection -> execution (insert 'u')
# 
#

class Solution:
    def minDistance(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> int:

        m, n = map(len, (word1, word2))
        if m * n == 0: return m + n

        dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]

        for i in range(m + 1):
            dp[i][0] = i

        for j in range(n + 1):
            dp[0][j] = j

        for i in range(1, m + 1):
            for j in range(1, n + 1):
                left = dp[i-1][j] + 1
                down = dp[i][j-1] + 1
                left_down = dp[i-1][j-1]

                if word1[i-1] != word2[j-1]:
                    left_down += 1

                dp[i][j] = min(left, down, left_down)

        return dp[m][n]
