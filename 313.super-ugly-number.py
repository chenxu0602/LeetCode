#
# Write a program to find the n^th super ugly number.
# 
# Super ugly numbers are positive numbers whose all prime factors are in the
# given prime list primes of size k.
# 
# Example:
# 
# 
# Input: n = 12, primes = [2,7,13,19]
# Output: 32 
# Explanation: [1,2,4,7,8,13,14,16,19,26,28,32] is the sequence of the first
# 12 
# ⁠            super ugly numbers given primes = [2,7,13,19] of size 4.
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# 1 is a super ugly number for any given primes.
# The given numbers in primes are in ascending order.
# 0 < k ≤ 100, 0 < n ≤ 10^6, 0 < primes[i] < 1000.
# The n^th super ugly number is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit signed integer.
