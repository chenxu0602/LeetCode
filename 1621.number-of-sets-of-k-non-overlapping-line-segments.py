#
# Given n points on a 1-D plane, where the i^th point (from 0 to n-1) is at x =
# i, find the number of ways we can draw exactly k non-overlapping line
# segments such that each segment covers two or more points. The endpoints of
# each segment must have integral coordinates. The k line segments do not have
# to cover all n points, and they are allowed to share endpoints.
# 
# Return the number of ways we can draw k non-overlapping line segments. Since
# this number can be huge, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: n = 4, k = 2
# Output: 5
# Explanation: 
# The two line segments are shown in red and blue.
# The image above shows the 5 different ways {(0,2),(2,3)}, {(0,1),(1,3)},
# {(0,1),(2,3)}, {(1,2),(2,3)}, {(0,1),(1,2)}.
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: n = 3, k = 1
# Output: 3
# Explanation: The 3 ways are {(0,1)}, {(0,2)}, {(1,2)}.
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: n = 30, k = 7
# Output: 796297179
# Explanation: The total number of possible ways to draw 7 line segments is
# 3796297200. Taking this number modulo 10^9 + 7 gives us 796297179.
# 
# 
# Example 4:
# 
# 
# Input: n = 5, k = 3
# Output: 7
# 
# 
# Example 5:
# 
# 
# Input: n = 3, k = 2
# Output: 1
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 2 <= n <= 1000
# 1 <= k <= n-1
#

    def numberOfSets(self, n: int, k: int) -> int:
        import math
        return math.comb(n + k - 1, k * 2) % (10**9 + 7)
