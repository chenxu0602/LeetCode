#
# On a table are N cards, with a positive integer printed on the front and back
# of each card (possibly different).
# 
# We flip any number of cards, and after we choose one card. 
# 
# If the number X on the back of the chosen card is not on the front of any
# card, then this number X is good.
# 
# What is the smallest number that is good?  If no number is good, output 0.
# 
# Here, fronts[i] and backs[i] represent the number on the front and back of
# card i. 
# 
# A flip swaps the front and back numbers, so the value on the front is now on
# the back and vice versa.
# 
# Example:
# 
# 
# Input: fronts = [1,2,4,4,7], backs = [1,3,4,1,3]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: If we flip the second card, the fronts are [1,3,4,4,7] and the
# backs are [1,2,4,1,3].
# We choose the second card, which has number 2 on the back, and it isn't on
# the front of any card, so 2 is good.
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# 1 <= fronts.length == backs.length <= 1000.
# 1 <= fronts[i] <= 2000.
# 1 <= backs[i] <= 2000.
#

            if x not in same:

        return ans % 9999
