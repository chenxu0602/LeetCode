# Find the total area covered by two rectilinear rectangles in a 2D plane.
# 
# Each rectangle is defined by its bottom left corner and top right corner as
# shown in the figure.
# 
# 
# 
# Example:
# 
# 
# Input: A = -3, B = 0, C = 3, D = 4, E = 0, F = -1, G = 9, H = 2
# Output: 45
# 
# Note:
# 
# Assume that the total area is never beyond the maximum possible value of int.
#

class Solution:
    def computeArea(self, A: int, B: int, C: int, D: int, E: int, F: int, G: int, H: int) -> int:

        overlap = max(min(C, G) - max(A, E), 0) * max(min(D, H) - max(B, F), 0)
        return (A - C) * (B - D) + (E - G) * (F - H) - overlap
