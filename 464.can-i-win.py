#
# In the "100 game," two players take turns adding, to a running total, any
# integer from 1..10. The player who first causes the running total to reach or
# exceed 100 wins. 
# 
# What if we change the game so that players cannot re-use integers? 
# 
# For example, two players might take turns drawing from a common pool of
# numbers of 1..15 without replacement until they reach a total >= 100.
# 
# Given an integer maxChoosableInteger and another integer desiredTotal,
# determine if the first player to move can force a win, assuming both players
# play optimally. 
# 
# You can always assume that maxChoosableInteger will not be larger than 20 and
# desiredTotal will not be larger than 300.
# 
# 
# Example
# 
# Input:
# maxChoosableInteger = 10
# desiredTotal = 11
# 
# Output:
# false
# 
# Explanation:
# No matter which integer the first player choose, the first player will lose.
# The first player can choose an integer from 1 up to 10.
# If the first player choose 1, the second player can only choose integers from
# 2 up to 10.
# The second player will win by choosing 10 and get a total = 11, which is >=
# desiredTotal.
# Same with other integers chosen by the first player, the second player will
# always win.
