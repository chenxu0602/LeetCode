#
# Starting with a positive integer N, we reorder the digits in any order
# (including the original order) such that the leading digit is not zero.
# 
# Return trueÂ if and only if we can do this in a way such that the resulting
# number is a power of 2.
#

# 
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: 1
# Output: true
# 
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: 10
# Output: false
# 
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: 16
# Output: true
# 
# 
# 
# Example 4:
# 
# 
# Input: 24
# Output: false
# 
# 
# 
# Example 5:
# 
# 
# Input: 46
# Output: true
