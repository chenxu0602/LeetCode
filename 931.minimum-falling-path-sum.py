# Testcase Example:  '[[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]'
#
# Given a square array of integers A, we want the minimum sum of a falling path
# through A.
# 
# A falling path starts at any element in the first row, and chooses one
# element from each row.Â  The next row's choice must be in a column that is
# different from the previous row's column by at most one.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
# Output: 12
# Explanation: 
# The possible falling paths are:
# 
# 
# 
# [1,4,7], [1,4,8], [1,5,7], [1,5,8], [1,5,9]
# [2,4,7], [2,4,8], [2,5,7], [2,5,8], [2,5,9], [2,6,8], [2,6,9]
# [3,5,7], [3,5,8], [3,5,9], [3,6,8], [3,6,9]
# 
# 
# The falling path with the smallest sum is [1,4,7], so the answer is 12.
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# 1 <= A.length == A[0].length <= 100
# -100 <= A[i][j] <= 100
# 
#
class Solution:
    def minFallingPathSum(self, A: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        while len(A) >= 2:
            row = A.pop()
            for i in range(len(row)):
                A[-1][i] += min(row[max(0, i-1): min(len(row), i+2)])
        return min(A[0])
