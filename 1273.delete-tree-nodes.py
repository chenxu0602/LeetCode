# Testcase Example:  '7\n[-1,0,0,1,2,2,2]\n[1,-2,4,0,-2,-1,-1]'
#
# A tree rooted at node 0 is given as follows:
# 
# 
# The number of nodes is nodes;
# The value of the i-th node is value[i];
# The parent of the i-th node is parent[i].
# 
# 
# Remove every subtree whose sum of values of nodes is zero.
# 
# After doing so, return the number of nodes remaining in the tree.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Input: nodes = 7, parent = [-1,0,0,1,2,2,2], value = [1,-2,4,0,-2,-1,-1]
# Output: 2
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 1 <= nodes <= 10^4
# -10^5 <= value[i] <= 10^5
# parent.length == nodes
# parent[0] == -1Â which indicates that 0 is the root.

        #         count += c
        #     return total, count if total else 0

        # return dfs(0)[1]

        for i in range(nodes - 1, -1, -1):
            value[parent[i]] += value[i]
            res[parent[i]] += res[i] if value[i] else 0
        return res[0] if value[0] else 0
