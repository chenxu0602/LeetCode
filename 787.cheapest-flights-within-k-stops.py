#
# There are n cities connected by m flights. Each flight starts from city u and
# arrives at v with a price w.
# 
# Now given all the cities and flights, together with starting city src and the
# destination dst, your task is to find the cheapest price from src to dst with
# up to k stops. If there is no such route, output -1.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# Input: 
# n = 3, edges = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[0,2,500]]
# src = 0, dst = 2, k = 1
# Output: 200
# Explanation: 
# The graph looks like this:
# 
# 
# The cheapest price from city 0 to city 2 with at most 1 stop costs 200, as
# marked red in the picture.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# Input: 
# n = 3, edges = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[0,2,500]]
# src = 0, dst = 2, k = 0
# Output: 500
# Explanation: 
# The graph looks like this:
# 
# 
# The cheapest price from city 0 to city 2 with at most 0 stop costs 500, as
# marked blue in the picture.
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# The number of nodes n will be in range [1, 100], with nodes labeled from 0 to
# n - 1.
# The size of flights will be in range [0, n * (n - 1) / 2].
# The format of each flight will be (src, dst, price).
# The price of each flight will be in the range [1, 10000].
# k is in the range of [0, n - 1].
# There will not be any duplicated flights or self cycles.
