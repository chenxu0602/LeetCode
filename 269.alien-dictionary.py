# Testcase Example:  '["wrt","wrf","er","ett","rftt"]'
#
# There is a new alien language which uses the latin alphabet. However, the
# order among letters are unknown to you. You receive a list of non-empty words
# from the dictionary, where words are sorted lexicographically by the rules of
# this new language. Derive the order of letters in this language.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input:
# [
# ⁠ "wrt",
# ⁠ "wrf",
# ⁠ "er",
# ⁠ "ett",
# ⁠ "rftt"
# ]
# 
# Output: "wertf"
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input:
# [
# ⁠ "z",
# ⁠ "x"
# ]
# 
# Output: "zx"
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input:
# [
# ⁠ "z",
# ⁠ "x",
# ⁠ "z"
# ] 
# 
# Output: "" 
# 
# Explanation: The order is invalid, so return "".
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# You may assume all letters are in lowercase.
# You may assume that if a is a prefix of b, then a must appear before b in the
# given dictionary.
# If the order is invalid, return an empty string.
# There may be multiple valid order of letters, return any one of them is
# fine.
