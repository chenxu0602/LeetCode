# Testcase Example:  '["a","b","ba","bca","bda","bdca"]'
#
# Given a list of words, each word consists of English lowercase letters.
# 
# Let's say word1 is a predecessor of word2 if and only if we can add exactly
# one letter anywhere in word1 to make it equal to word2.  For example, "abc"
# is a predecessor of "abac".
# 
# A word chain is a sequence of words [word_1, word_2, ..., word_k] with k >=
# 1, where word_1 is a predecessor of word_2, word_2 is a predecessor of
# word_3, and so on.
# 
# Return the longest possible length of a word chain with words chosen from the
# given list of words.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: ["a","b","ba","bca","bda","bdca"]
# Output: 4
# Explanation: one of the longest word chain is "a","ba","bda","bdca".
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# 1 <= words.length <= 1000
# 1 <= words[i].length <= 16
# words[i] only consists of English lowercase letters.

class Solution:
    def longestStrChain(self, words: List[str]) -> int:
        dp = {}
        for w in sorted(words, key=len):
            dp[w] = max(dp.get(w[:i] + w[i+1:], 0) + 1 for i in range(len(w)))
        return max(dp.values())
