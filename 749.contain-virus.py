# 
# A virus is spreading rapidly, and your task is to quarantine the infected
# area by installing walls.
# 
# The world is modeled as a 2-D array of cells, where 0 represents uninfected
# cells, and 1 represents cells contaminated with the virus.  A wall (and only
# one wall) can be installed between any two 4-directionally adjacent cells, on
# the shared boundary.
# 
# Every night, the virus spreads to all neighboring cells in all four
# directions unless blocked by a wall.
# Resources are limited. Each day, you can install walls around only one region
# -- the affected area (continuous block of infected cells) that threatens the
# most uninfected cells the following night. There will never be a tie.
# 
# Can you save the day? If so, what is the number of walls required? If not,
# and the world becomes fully infected, return the number of walls used.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# Input: grid = 
# [[0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1],
# ⁠[0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1],
# ⁠[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1],
# ⁠[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
# Output: 10
# Explanation:
# There are 2 contaminated regions.
# On the first day, add 5 walls to quarantine the viral region on the left. The
# board after the virus spreads is:
# 
# [[0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1],
# ⁠[0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1],
# ⁠[0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1],
# ⁠[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]
# 
# On the second day, add 5 walls to quarantine the viral region on the right.
# The virus is fully contained.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# Input: grid = 
# [[1,1,1],
# ⁠[1,0,1],
# ⁠[1,1,1]]
# Output: 4
# Explanation: Even though there is only one cell saved, there are 4 walls
# built.
# Notice that walls are only built on the shared boundary of two different
# cells.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# Input: grid = 
# [[1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0],
# ⁠[1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1],
# ⁠[1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
# Output: 13
# Explanation: The region on the left only builds two new walls.
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# The number of rows and columns of grid will each be in the range [1, 50].
# Each grid[i][j] will be either 0 or 1.
# Throughout the described process, there is always a contiguous viral region
# that will infect strictly more uncontaminated squares in the next round.
# 
#
