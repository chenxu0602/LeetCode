#
# We can rotate digits by 180 degrees to form new digits. When 0, 1, 6, 8, 9
# are rotated 180 degrees, they become 0, 1, 9, 8, 6 respectively. When 2, 3,
# 4, 5 and 7 are rotated 180 degrees, they become invalid.
# 
# A confusing number is a number that when rotated 180 degrees becomes a
# different number with each digit valid.(Note that the rotated number can be
# greater than the original number.)
# 
# Given a positive integer N, return the number of confusing numbers between 1
# and NÂ inclusive.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: 20
# Output: 6
# Explanation: 
# The confusing numbers are [6,9,10,16,18,19].
# 6 converts to 9.
# 9 converts to 6.
# 10 converts to 01 which is just 1.
# 16 converts to 91.
# 18 converts to 81.
# 19 converts to 61.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: 100
# Output: 19
# Explanation: 
# The confusing numbers are
# [6,9,10,16,18,19,60,61,66,68,80,81,86,89,90,91,98,99,100].
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# 1 <= N <= 10^9
#
