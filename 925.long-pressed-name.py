# Testcase Example:  '"alex"\n"aaleex"'
#
# Your friend is typing his name into a keyboard.  Sometimes, when typing a
# character c, the key might get long pressed, and the character will be typed
# 1 or more times.
# 
# You examine the typed characters of the keyboard.  Return True if it is
# possible that it was your friends name, with some characters (possibly none)
# being long pressed.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: name = "alex", typed = "aaleex"
# Output: true
# Explanation: 'a' and 'e' in 'alex' were long pressed.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: name = "saeed", typed = "ssaaedd"
# Output: false
# Explanation: 'e' must have been pressed twice, but it wasn't in the typed
# output.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: name = "leelee", typed = "lleeelee"
# Output: true
# 
# 
# 
# Example 4:
# 
# 
# Input: name = "laiden", typed = "laiden"
# Output: true
# Explanation: It's not necessary to long press any character.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# name.length <= 1000
# typed.length <= 1000
# The characters of name and typed are lowercase letters.
