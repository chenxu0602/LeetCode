#
# Given an array of integers where 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ n (n = size of array), some
# elements appear twice and others appear once.
# 
# Find all the elements of [1, n] inclusive that do not appear in this array.
# 
# Could you do it without extra space and in O(n) runtime? You may assume the
# returned list does not count as extra space.
# 
# Example:
# 
# Input:
# [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]
# 
# Output:
# [5,6]

        # Space InPlace Modification Solution

        # Space complexity: O(1)

            new_index = abs(nums[i]) - 1

            # Check the magnitude of value at this new index
            # If the magnitude is positive, make it negative 
            # thus indicating that the number nums[i] has 
            # appeared or has been visited.
            if nums[new_index] > 0:
                nums[new_index] *= -1

        # Response array that would contain the missing numbers
        result = []

        # Iterate over the numbers from 1 to N and add all those
        # that have positive magnitude in the array
