#
# Suppose you have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted and
# some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots - they
# would compete for water and both would die.
# 
# Given a flowerbed (represented as an array containing 0 and 1, where 0 means
# empty and 1 means not empty), and a number n, return if n new flowers can be
# planted in it without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1
# Output: True
# 
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2
# Output: False
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# The input array won't violate no-adjacent-flowers rule.
# The input array size is in the range of [1, 20000].
# n is a non-negative integer which won't exceed the input array size.
#
